You'll find plenty of restaurants right near the sand, and many people bring picnics to enjoy. This is a wonderful place to watch the sunset. Make sure you visit at least once during this time of day for beautiful views of the blazing sun sinking slowly into the Indian Ocean.

This clean stretch of golden sand and blue-green water boasts a beautiful setting between Noosa National Park and the chic shops and cafés of Hastings Street. Its sheltered and sunny north-facing aspect makes it popular year-round. At the eastern end of the shoreline, the national park cloaks the headland, and if you hike up the hill into the park, you can often spot koalas in the trees. Swimmers love the clean, clear waters, and surfers love to ride the long waves paralleling the headland at the famous First Point. The Noosa Festival of Surfing takes place here each March. Children and adults alike love to ferret among the rock pools at the eastern end of the beach, and the boardwalk along the beach is a popular place for a sunset stroll. The beach is patrolled throughout the year. When you need a break from the sun, Hastings Street – one of Noosa's top attractions – is steps away from the sand, with gourmet restaurants, cafés, shops, and galleries. During summer and school holidays, city slickers from Sydney and Melbourne flock to Noosa Heads for their vacation, so parking in the little beach lot can be a challenge, but other lots are nearby. Better still, you can forget about finding a parking spot and stay at Netanya Noosa right on the beachfront in a spacious apartment with a full kitchen.", Queensland,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Noosa+Main+Beach/

A mere 15 minutes by car or bus from Sydney's CBD, this curvy one-kilometer strand of blond sand and clear blue sea is one of the best beaches in Sydney. It's so famous that it stars in its own Aussie reality TV show, Bondi Rescue. The beach is home to the country's first documented surf life saving club, dating from 1907. In safe conditions, this is a beautiful spot to swim or surf, but it's important to stay between the flags here, as dangerous rip tides can sweep unsuspecting swimmers out to sea.

Con Dao is an island that is part of an archipelago off the southern region of the country. Since it is separated from the mainland with little transportation on the island, it is not overcrowded with tourists. The clear, blue water is perfect for swimming and water sports.

The more tranquil scene in Quy Nhon is why luxury resorts like AVANI Quy Nhon Resort & Spa thrive, with spa getaways, spacious rooms, and local cuisine experiences.

Pantai Cenang, the most famous beach on the islands, is also the best developed–it has cafés and restaurants, plenty of shops to rent water sports equipment, sun loungers right on the soft white sand, and plenty of opportunities to catch a boat to island-hop or try parasailing. Pantai Tengah, right next to Pantai Cenang, has all-inclusive resorts and spas just steps from the crystal blue waters, while Datai Bay beach has a background of forests with plenty of trails for exploring. A number of dinner and sunset cruises also leave from the beach, and visitors can arrange snorkeling on the popular Payar Island, a protected marine park famous for its multi-hued corals and rich marine life.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Langkawi/
85, Tioman Island,Malaysia,"The entire surface of Tioman Island is a nature preserve surrounded by some of the whitest beaches in Malaysia. Although sparsely inhabited, the island receives lots of tourists who come here to snorkel and scuba dive–partly because Tioman is a duty-free area, so local prices are much lower than in other popular islands in Malaysia. A densely forested island with spectacular coral reefs, Tioman also attracts surfers and nature lovers, who come here to see protected species and try jungle trekking. Tioman suffered a mass coral bleaching in 2010 that affected or killed sections of its coral, but the protected status of the island has helped the coastline recover, and the remaining coral is still in good health today. The best time to visit the island is March to October, as the monsoon rains hit the island hard during the rest of the year, and many hotels close for the season.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tioman+Island/
86, Bachok,Malaysia,"The Bachok area is located right on the South China Sea and attracts lots of tourists not only because of its beautiful sandy coastline but also for its dense jungle-covered hills, perfect for hiking in a more rural area with plenty of local flavor. The town's main beach is Pantai Irama (""beach of melody""), which attracts many locals, and it's often lively with music or special events during the weekends. On weekdays, however, you might as well have the entire coastline to yourself–a quiet place for a long walk on the sand and a cold drink. Another great local beach is Pantai Bisikan Bayu (""beach of whispering breeze""), which gets its name because of the rustling sound of the shoreline trees here. A favorite for surfers, this beach is busier than Pantai Irama but also surrounded by more attractions, including museums, the Istana Balai Besar palace, and a number of nature walks. Not far away, there's also Pantai Cahaya Bulan (""moonlight beach""), a favorite with families for its clear blue waters and great sunsets.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bachok/
87, Tanjung Bungah,Malaysia,"Not far from George Town on Penang Island, this is considered one of the main beach destinations for those looking for an active holiday. Whether you want to jet ski, kayak through the islands, parasail, or try scuba diving and snorkeling in a chill atmosphere, Tanjung Bungah is the beach to beat. Surrounded by world-class resorts, high-end restaurants, and all the shopping you can possibly want, this is not a beach for quiet contemplative walks, but one for adventure and excitement. The Tanjung Bungah Market, visited by both locals and tourists, is a great place to grab a quick souvenir, but also the perfect destination to try some authentic Malaysian cuisine without inflated touristy prices. For something unique, the Penang Toy Museum, considered the largest of its kind in the world, is just minutes from the beach and a great place to visit regardless of how old you are.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tanjung+Bungah/
88, Redang Island,Malaysia,"Crystal-clear waters, healthy colorful coral, and the softest white sand you can hope for might explain why Redang Island is a sun-lovers' favorite. While monsoon rains keep the island pretty much closed between October and March, the rest of the year, the all-inclusive resorts here are always full. Pasir Panjang Beach has the most upscale accommodations and a palm-fringed coastline that seems to go on forever, but Teluk Dalam is the beach to visit if you want a more secluded area and quiet mornings. Teluk Dalam does come alive in the afternoons, when there are often impromptu beach soccer or volleyball games and sometimes live music. Redang Island plays an important role in the survival of endangered sea turtles, and much of its marine waters are now protected. This actually benefits the many diving sites around the island, as they are maintained carefully, and the coral reefs are in great health.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Redang+Island/
89, Semporna,Malaysia,"The mainland coastal town of Semporna is the main gateway to a number of islands–some of which have their own accommodations and some that make for perfect day trips from town. Sipadan Island, for example, is completely surrounded by long stretches of picture-perfect golden beaches and home to one of the world's most diverse marine habitats. Kapalai Island, on the other hand, is a tiny, secluded island with only one resort but plenty of beautiful coral, perfect for diving. For the ultimate in luxury scuba diving, Mataking takes the top spot. Not only does the island have some of the most pristine beaches in the area, but this island is also the private property of The Reef Dive Resort, which offers exclusive diving and snorkeling trips and the world's first underwater post office.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Semporna/
90, Port Dickson,Malaysia,"Beaches dot the entire coastline of this beautiful town, just one hour drive away from Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur. The beach here extends for an impressive 18 kilometers, reaching from the sleepy Tanjung Tuan village to the coastal village of Tanjung Gemuk. The five-star Admiral Marina & Leisure Club is one of the most stunning docks in the country and often sees not only cruises stopping here, but also regattas and sailing events. Highly developed, clean, and beautiful, the beaches in Port Dickson have it all. Pantai Cermin, with sands that are almost orange, is one of the quieter beaches and a perfect place to catch the sunrise. Tanjung Tuan is even more secluded and can only be reached after a short hike through the thick jungle–and although swimming here isn't recommended because of the sharp corals, it's the perfect place to relax and even visit a historical lighthouse. If you want amenities and easy access, Teluk Kemang beach, right in town, is your best option, as there are plenty of things to do here. Water sports are popular, and you'll find many places to grab a snack or rent equipment or even your own gazebo. Popularity means crowds, however, so don't expect solitude here. Pantai Cahaya Negeri, another popular town beach shaped like a crescent moon, has a wooden bridge connecting it to a second island covered in mangroves and quiet areas for an evening walk.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Port+Dickson/
91, Pangkor Island,Malaysia,"A resort destination that's heavily forested but surrounded by a powdery gold, sandy coastline, Pangkor is a duty-free island–which means more affordable accommodations and shopping opportunities. Pangkor is just three hours from Kuala Lumpur, making it a popular weekend destination. Pasi Bogak is the most developed beach on the island, with plenty of resorts near the shore, coconut trees for some welcome shade, and several kilometers of unspoiled beauty and soft, blue waters to swim in. Teluk Nipah is a quieter beach, secluded in a tiny bay and often completely deserted in the mornings. If you don't just feel like laying on the sand all day, Teluk Nipah is a good place to rent a boat or kayak to explore the waters and islets around or to try one of the local food stalls selling traditional noodle dishes. A 30-minute boat ride from the coastal town of Lumut, Coral Beach is the hardest to reach of all the beaches here, but the extra work is more than worth it. With no Jet Skis or loud music, this is the perfect destination to enjoy the swaying palms–a pristine beach of powdery white sands and turquoise waters that offers plenty of privacy and untouched beauty.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pangkor+Island/
92, Jodogahama Beach,Japan,"Located on the Rikuchu Coast, this small beach is flanked by pine forests and volcanic white rocks. The name Jodogahama translates to ""Pure Land Beach,"" a reference to the scenic beauty of this hidden inlet. This is a great beach for swimming, with crystal-clear blue waters and calm waves. The beach itself is rocky and not great for digging your toes in the sand, but the beauty and quiet atmosphere of the area more than makes up for it. The nearby Jodogahama Visitor Center is a great place to learn more about the area or to grab a map of the nearby hiking trails. For those looking for a more relaxing activity, a number of cruises depart from the beach to tour the nearby waters and islands, as well as the famous Blue Cave.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jodogahama+Beach/
93, Okinawa Beaches,Japan,"The Okinawa prefecture has a tropical climate, making it Japan's best area for beach activities. In addition to remote beaches and great coral reefs, the area also offers the longest beach season in the country — most beaches in Okinawa open in March and don't close until October, with many staying open year-round. While the most famous beaches are great for snorkeling and diving, the most remote ones — especially the ones near the Kerama and Miyako islands — are a better choice if you're after more secluded shorelines. Of the over 100 beaches in Okinawa, Manza is one of the most famous. Part of the ANA InterContinental Manza Beach Resort, the beach is open to everyone and offers plenty of beach activities, including kayak and banana boat rentals, swimming, and kayaking. The popular Cape Manzamo is nearby and can be reached on foot — a great idea if you want to catch a breathtaking view of the sunset over the China Sea. Emerald Beach, where the famous Churaumi Aquarium is located, and Kouri Beach and its scenic rock formation that resembles two hearts popping out of the water, are also popular destinations for beachgoers.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Okinawa+Beaches/
94, Kamakura Beaches,Japan,"Located just an hour down the coast from Tokyo and a favorite among city dwellers, the Kamakura beaches offer the perfect sandy escape. Because of their location, the beach season here is very short — only July and August — and the shoreline gets crowded once kids are out of school. But if you don't have time to travel to other beaches farther away, the Kamakura beaches are still a great choice — plus the area gets bonus points because you can see Mt. Fuji while lying on the sand. There are three main beaches in Kamakura: Yuigahama and Zaimokuza are the two most popular ones and the busiest. They offer all kinds of marine activities including surfing, flyboarding, and wakeboarding. These two beaches are right next to each other, offering a one-kilometer stretch of golden sand perfect for swimming and sunbathing. Visitors can rent equipment, buy food and drinks, or sit at one of the many beachside cafés. The most distant beach is Zaimokuza Beach, popular for sea-kayaking, paddleboarding, and water-biking. While there are fewer amenities here, the beach is also less crowded and a quieter escape.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kamakura+Beaches/
95, Zushi Beach,Japan,"Tokyo's closest natural beach is surprisingly quiet most of the time. Once upon a time, this beach had a bad reputation: as it is located right next to a US military base, it had become the go-to place for late-night noise. Now clean and with very specific restrictions in place — no sound systems, no tattoos allowed — it has become a popular destination to watch the sunset. For those looking for something fun to do, the cliffs around offer plenty of short trails, and you can visit one of the many cafés and restaurants near the beach for a quick bite to eat. During July and August, lots of paddleboarders and windsurfers arrive to enjoy the soft waves, but June and September are quieter and perfect for swimming or just sunbathing, if the weather agrees.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zushi+Beach/
96, Shirahama Onsen,Japan,"The Shirahama resort area has been known for centuries as one of Japan's most famous hot springs (onsen) destinations. However, this beautiful region in the Wakayama prefecture also has plenty of stunning beaches to offer. The 700-meter-long Shirahama Beach offers soft white sands and gentle turquoise waters plus a number of open-air baths, so you can have the best of both worlds. The beach is usually packed during July and August — people come here to surf, snorkel, or simply to enjoy the sun. This is also the area's most developed beach: you'll find everything from food stands to rental shops just steps from the sand. Walk to the end of the beach to find a beautiful Shirahama Jinja red gate on top of a rock. Nearby Shirahama Chuo and Sotoura beaches are smaller and slightly less busy. However, these beaches offer plenty of restaurants and pensions in the vicinity, so they're a great destination if you want to spend a night by the beach.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Shirahama+Onsen/
97, Odaiba Beach,Japan,"Odaiba might not be the most stunning beach in Japan, but as Tokyo's only official beach, it's still one of the most visited. Artificially created to sit right on Tokyo Bay, the 800-meter-long Odaiba Beach is surrounded by shopping malls, a pier, and plenty of amenities to keep visitors happy. While the water here is not great for swimming, the golden sands of Odaiba are perfect for evening walks, watching the sunset, and just relaxing in the sun. During summer, the city organizes beach volleyball and sailing competitions, and in July, people stop by to see paper lanterns lit up during the matsuri festival. Odaiba Beach is the perfect half-day escape for residents and visitors in Tokyo, especially if you want to combine it with some dining and shopping.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Odaiba+Beach/
98, Tsunoshima Island,Japan,"The island of Tsunoshima is connected to the mainland by the massive 1,780-meters-long Tsunoshima Bridge. Though the island is small at just four square kilometers, the turquoise waters and white beaches here more than make up for its size. Reaching the main beach requires a tricky walk on a narrow road away from the parking lot — make your way here, and you'll be rewarded with clean sands, a great view of the bridge, and, more than likely, lots of solitude. That's because this small beach doesn't have any facilities, so most visitors head to the bigger beach on the other side of the bridge. The north-side beach offers showers and toilets, as well as areas for barbecuing. It's a favorite destination to watch the sunset over the bridge and to swim, as the water is calm and shallow. If you have time, you can continue on to explore other beaches on the island. Some are small and almost completely hidden, while others are wider and full of activities during the summer months.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tsunoshima+Island/
99, Amami Oshima Island,Japan,"Located right between Kyushu and Okinawa, two of Japan's largest islands, the Amami Island is home to several beaches. Surrounded by coral reef and with a background of volcanic mountains covered in deep green forest, the beaches on Amami are particularly stunning. Beach season on the island lasts from May to October, but even in the heat of summer, the islands remain mostly empty. There are few amenities here, with public restrooms and parking lots often being the only thing available around. Secluded, quiet, and clean, these are the right beaches for people looking for calm and perhaps clear waters for swimming or snorkeling. Tomori Beach, the most famous of all the beaches on the island, offers great snorkeling, while Kurasaki Beach is the go-to destination for divers. Because it's not accessible via public transportation, Yadoribama Beach gets fewer visitors, and it's the preferred destination for campers.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Amami+Oshima+Island/
100, Kujukuri Beach,Japan,"Kujukuri Beach is one of Japan's longest beaches — a 60-kilometer stretch of sandy coastline in the Chiba prefecture, very close to Tokyo. While most beaches in Japan consist of small sections of sand in capes or bays, Kujukuri Beach is straight, flat, and open to the sea. As the beach has no reef, and the Pacific waves crash right into the coastline, the conditions for surfing are excellent. When strong currents come in, sand dunes up to six meters high form on the beach. The water at Kujukuri remains warm well into October, making the beach perfect for swimming even after the summer fades away. Despite its size, Kujukuri Beach remains mostly underdeveloped, with just a few high-rise hotels in the distance and small shops and local restaurants on the streets around it.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kujukuri+Beach/
101, Miyako Island Beaches,Japan,"Miyako Island has a reputation for being home to some of Japan's most beautiful beaches. One of the country's most popular snorkeling and diving destinations, the island also benefits from mild weather that keeps the beaches open all year-round. Of the island's many beaches, Maehama Beach and Yoshino Beach are two of the best. Yoshino Beach is famous for its world-class snorkeling, as it's located near a massive coral reef with great marine life. Maehama Beach is the preferred destination for water sports, including kayak and boat rentals. Both beaches offer cotton-white, soft sands and deep blue waters, and both have showers, a rental shop for equipment, and toilets available.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Miyako+Island+Beaches/
102, Izu Peninsula,Japan,"A short trip away from Tokyo, the beaches at the Izu Peninsula look and feel a world away. The long coastline on the peninsula offers decent snorkeling and great blue waters for swimming. The beaches on the east side of the peninsula are busier, have lifeguards in summer, and offer rental shops and restaurants. Atami Sun Beach is right next to a train station, so it gets crowded during high season but also offers plenty of amenities. Nearby Nagahama Beach and Ito Orange Beach are less crowded but still very popular, and both offer beach huts and are great for swimming. Beaches on the south side of the Izu Peninsula are more remote but better for snorkeling, as the blue waters are calm and richer in marine life. Hirizo Beach allows beach camping and has some food and drink stalls and rental shops nearby. The other two beaches in the area — Yagawa Beach and Mera Athletics Water Park and Kumomi Beach — have no facilities in place except showers and toilets.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Izu+Peninsula/
103, Tokashiki Islands,Japan,"The village of Tokashiki actually consists of 10 mountainous islands, though only the two largest — Tokashiki and Maejima — are inhabited. Tokashiki Island is a snorkeler's paradise, famous for its diverse marine life and white beaches, while Tokashiku Beach (on the opposite side of the island) is smaller and quiet — a perfect escape for those looking for a place to sunbathe and enjoy the deep blue waters. Tokashiku Beach is also home to many sea turtles, which come to the shore to feed when the tide is high. Those who want an even closer experience can arrange a ""swim with the turtles experience"" through the local Tokashiku Marine Village. Aharen Beach is the most developed beach in the area, offering plenty of restaurants and rental shops. This is a great beach for renting kayaks, but skip the snorkeling, as the marine life and the coral are not as rich here.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tokashiki+Islands/
104, Railay Beach,Thailand,"The majestic Railay Beach, one of the top attractions in Thailand, is only accessible by longtail boat since it sits on a small peninsula, but it is well worth the effort to get here. The soft white sand on the beach is only one part of the experience. Railay Beach is surrounded by cliffs and caves, limestone monoliths, jungle landscapes, and lagoon-like swimming areas. There are several smaller beaches that make up Railay Beach, and all are within close proximity. This stretch of coast is perfect for combining traditional beach time with some exploration around the island. The luxury accommodations at the Rayavadee Resort and Bhu Nga Thani Resort and Spa bring you close to nature, surrounding you with lush gardens, elaborate pools, and views of the beach even when you head back to the room to relax.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Railay+Beach/
105, Nai Harn Beach,Thailand,"Though Nai Harn Beach can get quite crowded, it is still one of the most popular beaches in Thailand. Located on Phuket, the beach is known for crystal clear water, white sand, and waves that are not overbearing when swimming. The beach is one of the most popular because of its consistent climate and weather conditions that make it suitable to visit year-round. Nearby restaurants and local food vendors make it convenient to stay a full day at the beach. A number of resorts like the Navatara Phuket Resort, The Nai Harn, and Sunsuri Phuket are within walking distance of the beach.", Phuket,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nai+Harn+Beach/
106, Haad Rin,Thailand,"Haad Rin Beach is one of the most popular of the nearly 30 beaches on the small island of Koh Phangan. The long stretch of white sand and blue water surrounded by coconut trees and cliffs makes it a picturesque beach day. The beach is generally an active scene, with spontaneous games of volleyball, people swimming, and vacationers enjoying water sports like jet skiing and kayaking. Nearby lodging ranges from private villas at Anantara Rasananda Koh Phangan Villas to full-service resorts, like the Santhiya Koh Phangan Resort & Spa and even hostels on the beach for those who are on a tight budget. The best time to visit is outside monthly full-moon events, when the area can get quite crowded with young beach-goers.", Koh Phangan,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Haad+Rin/
107, Phra Nang Cave Beach,Thailand,"For a beach surrounded by a stunning landscape and outdoor adventure that few others can match, visit the Phra Nang Cave Beach in Krabi Province in southern Thailand. Characterized by outcroppings of cliffs that are popular for rock climbing, the shallow water of this beach makes it a favorite stop for tourists and families looking for safer waters to swim. It can be overcrowded at times, but it is one of the most unique beaches in Thailand. For a more private beach experience, stay at a resort like the Rayavadee Resort, which secludes guests in the forest surroundings, with a low profile pool and beach area. Short trails near the beach take you through caves and showcase the area's landscape. Try some fresh fruit from a floating vendor to cool off in the heat. The best times to visit for decent weather and fewer crowds are May and October. High season is November through April.", Krabi Province,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Phra+Nang+Cave+Beach/
108, Maya Bay,Thailand,"The shallow, azure waters of Maya Bay on Koh Phi Phi, one of the world's most beautiful islands, are almost entirely surrounded by huge limestone monoliths. The aerial view of the beach makes it easy to see why this location was used as the backdrop for the Leonardo DiCaprio movie The Beach. The steep hills that surround the water make it feel like a private paradise, even though it is likely to be crowded with visitors and longtail boats when you go. Since the bay is a large reef, you will see many tropical fish – snorkeling is one of the popular things to do here. The best time to visit is during the high tourist season from November to April when seas are calm. Unless you want to stay in Phuket and ferry to the island, you can stay near the bay at the SAii Phi Phi Island Village or Paradise Pearl Bungalows and just pay a small national park entry fee.", Koh Phi Phi,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Maya+Bay/
109, Pattaya Beach,Thailand,"About an hour south of all the attractions in Bangkok is Pattaya Beach, a popular tourist beach on Thailand's Gulf coast. The most notable feature is the hillside temple that sits above the sand. The area that was once a fishing village is now modernized with resorts and shopping. Large resorts like the artful Renaissance Pattaya Resort & Spa and the trendy Royal Wing Suites & Spa are among them. This is a great beach if you want to do water sports like parasailing or Jet Skis that you will not find on smaller beaches. Like other beaches near Bangkok, Pattaya Beach can be a bit crowded at times but still ideal if you enjoy strolling the crescent coastline or promenade area. The best time to visit Pattaya Beach is March through May, when the weather is typically fine but there are fewer tourists.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pattaya+Beach/
110, Chaweng Noi Beach,Thailand,"The popular beach of Chaweng on the island of Koh Samui can be quite crowded, which is why its smaller and more secluded version down the coast, Chaweng Noi, is a top choice. The shallow water, calm surf, and quiet beachfront make this beach perfect for a day of relaxation away from the crowds. Enjoy lunch from one of the many small beach restaurants with tables in the sand, or melt your worries away with an ocean-front massage from a local vendor. Luxury resorts like the Sandalwood Luxury Villas and Bo Phut Resort & Spa near the beach make you feel like you are on your own private island. Planning a visit between late December and April gives you the best beach weather on the island.", Koh Samui,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chaweng+Noi+Beach/
111, Freedom Beach,Thailand,"Spend a day relaxing or snorkeling in the clear waters of Freedom Beach in Phuket. It is best to take a longtail boat from Patong to reach the beachfront, as it is difficult to access by land. Be aware that you will need to pay a small entrance fee, but the view is worth it. The Avista Hideaway Hotel has a small path to the beach if you are up for a short hike. Freedom Beach is typical of the picturesque, unspoiled beach scene that you expect to see in tropical Thailand. The best time to visit is December through February.", Phuket,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Freedom+Beach/
112, Bottle Beach,Thailand,"Like other popular beaches in Thailand, Bottle Beach can be crowded in high tourist seasons but for good reason. It is primitive and naturally beautiful. Other times though, this beach can be almost secluded and tranquil. Most visitors come here on day trips, so staying overnight will give you a chance to have the beach almost all to yourself in the early morning. You can stay in a bungalow on the beach at Bottle Beach 1 Resort, but many visitors stay on the island's east coast, in full-service accommodations at Buri Rasa Koh Phangan or Panviman Resort and take a longtail boat to the beach. Small bungalows and shacks on the beach give you shade from the Thailand sun in between your swims in the warm water.", Koh Phangan,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bottle+Beach/
113, Ao Prao Beach,Thailand,"With 14 white-sand beaches in Ko Samet there are plenty of choices in this area, but Ao Prao Beach is one of the best. The area is a weekend retreat for locals in Bangkok because of the jewel-toned water and soft white sand. Another great beach for families, visitors here can enjoy calm waters for swimming during the day and indulge in local seafood at a beachside restaurant in the evening. There are a number of high-end resorts, with options like luxury beachfront villas at Paradee Resort to comfortable cottages and spa amenities at Le Vimarn Cottages & Spa. Ao Prao Beach generally has decent weather year-round, but the best months to visit are October through February during the milder season.", Ko Samet,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ao+Prao+Beach/
114, Sairee Beach,Thailand,"One of the best views of a spectacular Thailand sunset is from Sairee Beach on the tiny island of Ko Tao. This is the happening spot on the island, with plenty of restaurants and water sports like diving and snorkeling. The long, narrow beach is great for walking, with unobstructed views of the sunrise and sunset, so it is a popular beach for photographers. This is also the main area for lodging on the entire island. You will find rooms at places like The Tarna Align Resort, designed for a perfect view of the sunsets. Sairee Beach is ideal to visit from February to September.", Ko Tao,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sairee+Beach/
115, Hua Hin Beach,Thailand,"With over four kilometers of sandy beachfront, Hua Hin has something for everybody: plenty of family-friendly activities such as banana boats and pony rides, great windsurfing and parasailing schools, and sun loungers and umbrellas as far as the eye can see. Hua Hin Beach has a more relaxed vibe than other beach destinations in Thailand, attracting visitors looking for rest and relaxation. At the far end of Hua Hin Beach, behind Khao Takiap hill, there's the small, palm-fringed Suan Son Beach. And for those up for a day trip, the spectacular Sam Roi Yot National Park is not far from Hua Hin and home to Laem Sala Beach, a secluded stretch of sand that is hard to access but is always peaceful with stunning water views. There are plenty of places to visit in Hua Hin and near the beach, including restaurants, world-class golf courses, and many shopping destinations. Plus, Hua Hin has many high-end resorts and luxury accommodations, such as the InterContinental Hua Hin Resort, which offers 119 guest rooms and suites and a private beachfront, and the exclusive V Villas Hua Hin, which offers private villas, infinity pools, and a private beach.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hua+Hin+Beach/
116, Camilo Beach,Portugal,"One of the prettiest beaches in southern Portugal, Camilo Beach lies near the lively seaside town of Lagos in the western Algarve. Hemmed in by sandstone cliffs and curiously formed rock formations, this delightful pocket of dazzling white sand is reached via a long wooden staircase that snakes down through a carpet of shrubby kermes oak and wrinkle-leaved rockrose. Lapped by warm, shallow, turquoise waters favored by snorkelers, Praia do Camilo's tranquil setting exudes an air of peaceful exclusivity despite its proximity to some of the region's major resorts. A small cliff-top restaurant serves sunbathers and tourists, where the menu is heightened by a fabulous panoramic sweep over the coastline between Lagos and distant Albufeira.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Camilo+Beach/
117, Falésia Beach,Portugal,"Stunningly picturesque, Falésia Beach shares a golden ribbon of sand nearly six kilometers in length in one of the most popular tourist areas in the Algarve. East of Albufeira, Praia da Falésia is flanked by a line of amazing cliffs painted with rich earthy hues: burnt ochre, rust red, and gingerbread orange. Years of erosion have molded this sandstone belt with sinuous furrows and deep gullies as if ploughed by an industrious ogre. A coastal path crowns the overhang and meanders through aromatic pine groves. Falésia's length is such that, even during high summer, you can find a quiet, uncrowded spot to relax and sunbathe. Overlooking the beach are a number of prime oceanfront resorts, including upmarket PortoBay Falésia, which offers café and restaurant options to non residents.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Falésia+Beach/
118, Amado Beach,Portugal,"Amado Beach is one of Portugal's premier surfing locations. Famed for its reliable and diversified waves, this beautiful half-moon strip of sand is banked by rolling dunes and falls within the boundaries of the protected Parque Natural do Sudoeste Alentejano e Costa Vicentina. Typifying many of the beaches found along the Algarve's wild and capricious Atlantic Ocean west coast, Praia do Amado boasts several surf schools, some of which are open year-round. Indeed, the setting is the venue for prestigious national and international surfing competitions. Remote and somewhat off the beaten track, Amado is not for the traditional resort-seeking tourist. Instead, this is a destination for independent, free-spirited travelers and those interested in the region's diverse flora and fauna.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Amado+Beach/
119, Quinta do Lago Beach,Portugal,"Set in the heart of the internationally renowned Parque Natural da Ria Formosa, Quinta do Lago Beach – effectively a huge sand bar – is accessed by following a long, narrow, finger-like bridge across a brine-laced reed bed and then walking the boardwalk to the water's edge. Much of the appeal of Praia da Quinta do Lago lies in the wealth of birdlife that calls this stretch of the Algarve home; the marshlands are home to numerous waders, and you can also usually observe graceful storks and flamingos. The beach is impressive and bereft of commercialism, save for an excellent restaurant noted for its seafood choice. The nearby Quinta do Lago Hotel caters to an upmarket clientele and is just minutes away from San Lorenzo Golf Club, one of the most celebrated golf courses in Portugal and southern Europe.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Quinta+do+Lago+Beach/
120, Martinhal Beach,Portugal,"Wonderfully secluded Martinhal Beach is a favorite destination for families in that it fronts the Martinhal Sagres Beach Family Resort Hotel, where food and drinks are available from chic oceanfront bistros. Praia do Martinhal's beautifully soft and golden sand forms a natural bay, which is landmarked by scenic outcrops of limestone rock. Teeming with marine life, these islets make for excellent diving excursions. Swimming is safe, and there are plenty of water sports activities. When a north wind prevails, the more adventurous can windsurf. Other things to do include beachcombing the walk to Sagres, a leisurely 30-minute amble west, and exploring the ruins of the Roman kilns situated east of the resort complex.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Martinhal+Beach/
121, Guincho Beach,Portugal,"One of Europe's top windsurfing and kitesurfing destinations, Guincho Beach enjoys a spectacular location on the Lisbon coast, six kilometers northwest of the cheery resort town of Cascais. Flanking the western edge of the Parque Natural de Sintra-Cascais, Praia do Guincho's vast expanse of sand greets a thunderous Atlantic Ocean. Together with a near constant breeze, this wild and windy beach provides ideal conditions for surfers, windsurfers, and kitesurfers confident enough to harness nature's raw and often unpredictable power. With little shelter from the elements, Guincho is not really a beach for tourists seeking solace under the sun. Nor is it particularly family focused. Instead, this is an adrenaline-packed choice for dedicated water sports enthusiasts.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Guincho+Beach/
122, Rocha Beach,Portugal,"One of the best-known beaches in Portugal, Praia da Rocha is named for the resort located near Portimão, the Algarve's second city. An impressive swathe of sand accessed by numerous boardwalks and walkways, Rocha is hugely popular with locals and tourists and is a favorite summer holiday destination. The beach is accessed from the seafront avenue, a busy thoroughfare lined with hotels, cafés, restaurants, and other recreational facilities. Interesting sightseeing diversions include the neighboring Portimão Marina and the Fortaleza de Santa Catarina fortress to the east of the beach, and the elevated viewpoint at Três Castelos at its far western end. This is where you can also admire mighty outcrops of sandstone rock (rocha means ""rock"" in Portuguese). For a light lunch, pop along to the historic Bela Vista Hotel & Spa, built in 1918 and one of the first hotels in the region.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rocha+Beach/
123, Nazaré Beach,Portugal,"Long distinguished for its traditional character, the fishing port of Nazaré is blessed with a fantastic beach that draws sun worshippers to this lively town in central Portugal. One celebrated visitor is American big-wave surfer Garrett McNamara, who rode a monster 30-meter (100-foot) wave here and surfed straight into the record books. That was over the Nazaré Canyon off Praia do Norte. Most surfers and tourists, however, settle for the far tamer Nazaré Beach, a glorious band of sand that hugs the town's wide, mosaic patterned promenade. Sunbathers share Praia da Nazaré with fisher folk, who can be observed mending nets or arranging mackerel and sardines on wire racks to dry. The old-world charm is tangible. Meanwhile, the esplanade is lined with plenty of authentic seafood restaurants, and shopping and sightseeing opportunities abound.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nazaré+Beach/
124, Comporta Beach,Portugal,"An hour's drive south of Lisbon, Comporta Beach exudes an appealing beach-shack vibe. Perched on the Tróia Peninsula – a slither of sand jutting out from the northwestern coastal reaches of Portugal's Alentejo province – this understated bolthole remains blissfully free from mass tourism. Named for the charming little whitewashed village of Comporta, a gem of a place straddled over rice paddies and salt pans and where every chimneystack, it seems, has been commandeered by white storks, pristine Praia da Comporta is the preserve of a chic, more discerning crowd, as well as in-the-know surfers. Here, thatched cabanas cling to shifting sand dunes and the bleached-wood restaurants punctuating the boardwalks surprise with their colorful and funky interiors.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Comporta+Beach/
125, Carcavelos Beach,Portugal,"Just 20 minutes west by train from central Lisbon, Carcavelos Beach is a hugely popular day excursion for locals and city-break travelers. With a near-two-kilometer shoreline of flawless sand, the beach is noted for its excellent leisure and water sports opportunities and, in particular, its surfing. Providing a historical backdrop is the 16th-century Forte de São Julião da Barra, an imposing military stronghold still in use and sited at the eastern end of Praia de Carcavelos. An excellent view is offered from the esplanade, which makes for a lovely walk at any time of year. Summertime sees the beach at its busiest though, especially at weekends and holiday periods when youngsters, family groups, and tourists converge here to escape the city heat.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Carcavelos+Beach/
126, Canto Marinho Beach,Portugal,"Wild, windy, and captivating, Canto Marinho Beach is where to enjoy nature in all its glorious seclusion. Backed by dunes embroidered with marram grass and sea holly, the beach is fronted by banks of rock visible at low tide, which makes it unsuitable for swimmers but rewards others with a series of shallow pools suitable for paddling and beachcombing. Most of all, Praia do Canto Marinho – in northern Portugal, not far from the historic city of Viana do Castelo – serves as a peaceful retreat for those seeking communion with the ocean well away from the hustle and bustle of modern life. Indeed, the entire beach lies within a protected environmental zone. Leave only footprints!", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Canto+Marinho+Beach/
127, Almograve Beach,Portugal,"Tucked away on the Alentejo coast halfway between Vila Nova de Milfontes and Zambujeira do Mar is this local secret that few tourists have discovered. Often described as the most attractive stretch of sand in the region, Almograve Beach affords sunseekers a choice of two very different leisure areas: a beach to the south with a rocky shoreline set against a craggy cliff line, the other towards the north, molded out of undulating sand dunes. This beach is a favorite hangout for surfers, but it's also a hit with families when the tide is out – the ankle-deep shallows provide an exciting seaside playground for youngsters. Overlooking Praia do Almograve is a cliff-top café that provides light refreshments, and amenities include handy restrooms.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Almograve+Beach/
128, Ribeira do Cavalo Beach,Portugal,"Isolated and better for it, this achingly attractive beach could be located in the Caribbean such is its exotic outlook and tropical veneer. In fact, it's found at the base of a cove along the coastline of the protected Arrábida Natural Park, and can only be reached on foot or by boat. This is probably how Mother Nature intended all beaches to look, a wedge of flaxen-hued sand lapped by crystalline water and hemmed in on three sides by a seemingly impenetrable mass of vegetation, itself clinging to some of the roughest cliffs in the region. It's a steep hike down to the water's edge, and there's not a café or vehicle in sight! Furthermore, there is no lifeguard service in operation. But if snorkeling in a secluded bay teeming with sealife is your idea of paradise, the effort to get here and the lack of amenities simply won't be a problem. And here's a tip: Pack all you need in a waterproof bag and join a kayaking tour that includes Praia da Ribeira do Cavalo on the itinerary. It really is the only way to travel!", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ribeira+do+Cavalo+Beach/
129, Porto Santo Beach,Portugal,"Moored off Madeira Island in the Atlantic Ocean is Porto Santo. Smaller and lesser known than its more illustrious neighbor, Porto Santo does however have an ace up its sleeve – the finest beach in the whole archipelago! Praia do Porto Santo stretches for nine kilometers along just about the entire southwestern coast of the island. It's divided into five smaller beaches, each with a name. The golden sand, organic in origin, is blended in areas with a concentration of detritus from the erosion of volcanic rocks to lend the beach an odd yellow and black two-tone appearance in places. The sand is believed to have therapeutic properties that help relieve all sorts of aches and pains. A number of low-key resorts, restaurants, cafés, and boutiques flank the beach, which as you can imagine is a favorite destination with sunseekers during the summer months.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Porto+Santo+Beach/
130, Copacabana,Brazil,"Brazil's most famous beach sits right in the heart of Rio de Janeiro. If you're looking for a quiet, secluded getaway where you can enjoy the soft sands on your own, this isn't it. This is a beach for people watching (and a favorite of South American models and actors), water sports including surfing, and entertainment. The boardwalk offers a number of cafés, restaurants, hotels, and even two historical forts, one of which houses a military museum. If you can afford the price tag, some of the best hotel room views are located right here, facing the green sea. Crescent-shaped Copacabana is just over four kilometers long and always busy. Even families will enjoy this beach. During the New Year's Eve celebrations, thousands and thousands of people congregate on the beach to wait for midnight.

131, Ilha Grande,Brazil,"Ilha Grande (Big Island) was once used as a quarantine place for people with leprosy. When the last hospital there closed, the island was abandoned and remained wild and uninhabited for decades. Once it was rediscovered as a prime destination, efforts were made to keep development to a minimum in order to preserve the island's fauna and flora, including endangered species like the brown howler monkey. Ilha Grande's forests are pristine; the island has no roads, and no vehicles of any kind are allowed. To reach the beach, visitors must first take a boat to Vila do Abraão, the main village on the island. From here, you can reach the island's many beaches either by boat or via a hike through tropical forest. The main beach is Lopes Mendes, a white, sandy stretch of coastline famous for its surfing. Getting here requires an additional boat ride to Pouso followed by a 20-minute forest hike. Alternatively, you can just leave from Vila do Abraão on a seven-kilometer hike through stunning thick jungle. Praia do Aventureiro - known to many as ""the bent palm tree beach"" or ""the postcard beach""- is one of the most beautiful beaches on the island.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ilha+Grande/
132, Ipanema,Brazil,"If the constant go-go-go energy of Copacabana seems a bit much, nearby Ipanema beach is a great place to visit instead. Perhaps one of the most famous beaches in the world (in part thanks to the unforgettable The Girl from Ipanema bossa nova song), Ipanema is classier and prettier than Copacabana, more about swimming and enjoying the sun than about non-stop action. The area's mild winters and massive surfs make this a favorite surfing destination - during winter, the swilling of the ocean near the coast creates amazing barrels of clear, light-blue water that surfers will definitely appreciate. Aside from the expected stalls selling food and drinks, the mosaic-like promenade here also offers an unexpected array of open-air gyms, always full of people pumping iron before stepping back onto the sand. Just west of Ipanema and over some soft sloping hills, there's a second beach called Lebon but best known as just Posto 10, a reference to the lifeguard station number 10 located here. For those in an active mood, the towering Dois Irmãos hill sits just minutes away and offers one of the most amazing views of Rio de Janeiro from the top.

133, Buzios Resort Town,Brazil,"Armação dos Búzios (or Buzios, as it's better known locally) sits north of Rio de Janeiro and it's a favorite among international celebrities. While the South American jet-set heads to Copacabana and other popular beaches, international stars wanting some privacy favor Buzos. The beach was a bit of a secret until Brigitte Bardot fell in love with it in the 1960s. Since then, it has become a sort of St. Tropez of South America. Of the many beaches in town, the most famous are possibly u-shaped Ferradura Beach, which offers great snorkeling, and Geribá Beach for its great surfing and many restaurants. Praia de Tucuns, near the south end area of town, is too windy for sunbathers, though that makes it perfect for those looking for a scenic area with smaller crowds. Because it doesn't see as much tourism as other beaches in the area, the pink sands remain soft and clean.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Buzios+Resort+Town/
134, Jericoacoara,Brazil,"If you're looking for a private corner of paradise, this is where you'll find it in Brazil. Up until 1998, the area around Jericoacoara beach didn't even have electricity. That's no longer the case - though street lights are still prohibited, and you can see a sea of stars once the sun sets - and tourists now head here in search of virgin sands and quiet spots for windsurfing. Getting to Jericoacoara beach requires a several-hours-long drive, with the last 45 minutes of it being mostly off-road through sand dunes, past little fishing villages, and along the sea. Aside from the white sands and the great sport-friendly winds, the main attraction here is the sunset. Visitors often come here to sit on the beach to watch the sun sink straight down into the ocean.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jericoacoara/
135, Florianopolis,Brazil,"A cosmopolitan, massive island home to 42 beaches, Florianopolis has something for everybody. One of the most popular areas is Lagoa da Conceição, a large lagoon surrounded by a combination of soft white beaches and heavily forested hills. Famous as a yoga and live-healthy destination, Lagoa da Conceição offers plenty of outdoor activities, including hiking and water sports such as windsurfing and sailing. Praia Mole (Mole Beach) nearby is a major surfing destination, but this tiny beach - just under one kilometer long - also offers plenty of hiking opportunities. A short trail departing from here will take visitors to Praia do Gravatá, one of the island's smallest islands at just 60 meters long but also one of the most secluded. Praia dos Ingleses and Santinho Beach are also great destinations. They sit next to each other, separated by rolling golden sand dunes. Sandboarding, which was invented in Florianopolis, is quite popular here - and as the name suggests, it involves dune surfing downhill on a board. Accommodation: Where to Stay in Florianopolis", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Florianopolis/
136, Praia de Pipa,Brazil,"The quiet northern Praia de Pipa beach has been a local favorite for decades, but most international tourists are still unaware of its existence. And while the town has grown significantly in the last couple of decades, the atmosphere remains casual and laid-back. This is in part due to laws protecting the area from damaging expansion and carefully choosing what can be built here and where. Still, Pipa has a very cosmopolitan choice of hotels and restaurants that cater to both backpackers and high-end boutique travelers. Praia de Pipa features golden sands against a background of 10-meter-high pinkish cliffs covered in green vegetation. Nearby Praia do Madeiro - just a few minutes away on foot - is a wider beach where you can rent kayaks or a sunbed, learn to surf, or just jump into the ocean for a swim. Both beaches are often visited by dolphins.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Praia+de+Pipa/
137, Praia do Rosa,Brazil,"Praia do Rosa (Rose beach) is technically a bay with a sandy section, but the sands here are so soft and the waters so perfectly clear blue that it's no surprise it has become a popular getaway. About seven kilometers long, Praia do Rosa is much wider when the tide is out, but even during high tide, there are plenty of things to do here, including trying water sports, swimming, or practicing your kitesurfing skills. A few restaurants and small posadas (inns) are dotted throughout the town – but generally speaking, there isn't much more to do here than enjoy nature. No parties, no nightlife. Between July and November, southern right whales arrive here and stay near the coast to give birth. Visitors from all over the continent come over during that time to catch sight of the gentle giants.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Praia+do+Rosa/
138, Porto de Galinhas,Brazil,"Porto de Galinhas is a laid-back resort town that offers the best of two worlds: all the peace and solitude you would want in a tropical paradise paired with crystal-clear waters and soft white sands that seem to go on forever. The main beach in the area is Porto de Galinhas beach, located right in the center of town. You'll find restaurants and food stalls here, but the palm-fringed beach remains mostly underdeveloped and it's still possible to find a little corner all to yourself. The natural pools in this area attract both swimmers and snorkelers year-round. Only accessible by boat, the nearby Praia dos Carneiros is an even quieter beach famous for its golden sands and the tiny white church that sits right on the shoreline. Toquinho Beach, not far away, offers all the peace you would want, plus a chance to hop on a boat for a day trip to Ilha de Santo Aleixo, a tiny uninhabited island just minutes away. If you can catch a private boat ride to the island on a weekday, chances are you'll have this corner of tropical haven all to yourself.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Porto+de+Galinhas/
139, Maragogi,Brazil,"The area of Maragogi is home to Brazil's largest barrier reef, a massive nature preserve, and some of the most beautiful natural pools in the country. The pools, named Galés, are only visible during low tide. Located about six kilometers from the main stretch of beach, they are only accessible via boat. Maragogi is located in Northeast Brazil, away from the buzz of the busiest beaches in the south. Here, river and ocean meet, offering a unique natural setting of calm, clean waters perfect for swimming but also for snorkeling and scuba diving among the coral reefs. Since 2015, the region has been hosting a number of outdoor events, including an annual Trail Running competition.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Maragogi/
140, Taipus de Fora,Brazil,"Turquoise blue waters, a background of coconut trees, and seven kilometers of the softest sands you'll find in Brazil make Taipus de Fora a favorite among tourists. Famous for its crystalline tidal pools, Taipus de Fora is one of the best snorkeling and diving destinations in Brazil. The corals are stunning, and the marine life abundant, but things are equally beautiful outside the water. Just minutes away from the shoreline, mangroves, waterfalls, and plenty of ""light"" jungle trails are waiting to be explored. Camping is also popular in the area, and you can pitch your tent very close to the beach for great views over the water. The town itself (still tiny despite the boom of tourism in recent years) offers hotels, restaurants, and plenty of fun shopping in the form of markets and boutique stores.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Taipus+de+Fora/
141, Praia do Espelho,Brazil,"With a name like Mirror Beach, what else can you expect but a place with crystalline blue waters and spectacular views all around. Located in the coastal town of Porto Seguro, this hidden treasure gets a lot less crowded than beaches in major towns – and that's partly because the only way to reach it is by driving on a dirt road for an hour. The palm-fringed beach is surrounded by reddish cliffs, and if you arrive in the evening, you can see the reflection of the moon casting on the mirrored waters.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Praia+do+Espelho/
142, Baia do Sancho,Brazil,"Located within a national marine park, this golden beach is home to a lot of wildlife, including protected turtles. Because of the UNESCO World Heritage Site status of the islands in the area, development here is basically non-existent. That means pristine azure waters, great driving opportunities, and lush vegetation – and all in quiet surroundings, since the beach itself is not easy to reach, so you won't run into many tourists. There's plenty to explore on foot, though, including treacherous trails that take you through openings in the rocks, and precarious ladders to then reward you with stunning views.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Baia+do+Sancho/
143, Lopes Mendes Beach,Brazil,"Lopes Mendes often makes the top lists of ""best beaches in the world"" – and for good reason. Just three kilometers long and surrounded by palm trees, the pristine sands of this beach are flanked at each end by two hills covered in thick jungle greenery. This makes Lopes Mendes feel completely isolated in its own corner of paradise – and as it's not that easy to reach, chances are you will get to enjoy it all on your own if you arrive in the early morning. The rough waves make it a difficult spot for swimming but a great destination for surfing.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lopes+Mendes+Beach/
144, Praia de Forno,Brazil,"With a name as Oven Beach, it's perhaps no surprise that the temperatures here often reach over 40 degrees Celsius in summer. But the name of this beach is actually connected to the red color of its sand, which is in turn caused by the abundance of a mineral rich in iron. This makes the sand itself get very hot, a perfect excuse to jump into the crystal-clear, blue waters for a swim. Climbing the rocky promontory on the far left will get you to a smaller, out-of-sight beach, popular with families. You won't get a lot of solitude here, but that also means a well-developed infrastructure with plenty of places to eat (including a floating restaurant) and rent snorkeling equipment, boats, and kayaks.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Praia+de+Forno/
145, Santos Beach,Brazil,"The municipality of Santos is home to a very unique beach, referred to by the locals as a ""beach garden."" This is because there's a massive five-kilometer-long garden running alongside the beach, separating the sand from a busy street filled with cafés and outdoor snack places. Because it's located just 31 kilometers from São Paulo, this is a popular weekend destination for city folks aching for a beach escape. The beach itself is famous for its unique white/greyish sands that make for a stunning view, as well as for its flat entrance to the sea, perfect for swimming.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Santos+Beach/
146, Ilha de Tinhare,Brazil,"Reachable by ferry, the car-free island of Tinhare offers a holiday paradise for those looking to relax and disconnect. A mix of soft golden sands, crystalline blue waters, and easy access to plenty of water sports provide a good balance of options for everybody. That's not to say the island doesn't have a good infrastructure in place – there are plenty of restaurants around, and you'll find rental shops for any active pursuit you want to explore. Plus, some of the best hotels in the area sit right on the beach, so you can dig your toes into the sand as soon as you step out of your room.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ilha+de+Tinhare/
147, Caraiva,Brazil,"You have to make an effort to reach Caraiva Beach, since no public transportation goes all the way there, but the peace and the charm of the area are well worth it. Once there, pick an accommodation (hotels and campgrounds are both easily accessible) and stay for a couple of days to truly enjoy the magic here, which includes stunning starry skies, a river that flows into the sea, and waters that change from crystalline to deep blue depending on the tide. Plenty of boats offer connections to other nearby beaches.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Caraiva/
148, Praia de Leao,Brazil,"Lions beach gets its name from a rock that looks like a sea lion lying down. It's an apt name for a beach that's considered the getaway to a very rich underwater world – and that includes not only animals but also a sunken fort. Arrive early in the morning to grab a space on the soft white sands, and you might catch sight of the dolphins that sometimes visit the area. Development has been kept to a minimum here, so either bring a picnic or stop somewhere on your way to Praia de Leao to stock up on snacks and cold drinks. The current can be very strong here, so swimming isn't always allowed, but you can lie back and enjoy the stunning views around.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Praia+de+Leao/
149, Praia Ilha do Campeche,Brazil,"Located near Florianópolis, this white sandy beach is just half-a-kilometer long – but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in beauty. The island where the beach is located is not much bigger, and getting there usually means catching a ride on a local fishing boat. While the warm turquoise waters are great for swimming, the ocean can get choppy because of the many boats around. The island itself is home to protected archeological sites – which means the number of visitors to the island is limited to less than 1,000 a day, and there is also little development here to prevent pollution. As a result, Praia Ilha doesn't offer any overnight stay options. But for day visitors, it means a corner of quiet paradise and a chance to join guided walks through the thick vegetation of the area.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Praia+Ilha+do+Campeche/
150, Tanjong Beach,Singapore,"Located on beautiful Sentosa Island, Tanjong Beach is the most secluded and remote of the three beach sections. This doesn't mean you'll be completely alone there – Sentosa Island receives over 20 million visitors per year – but Tanjong Beach offers better chances of finding a quiet spot under the palm trees. The beach is even quieter during weekdays. Arrive in the evening to catch sight of twinkling lights in the distance as cruise ships pass by. The beach sits on a crescent-shaped bay, and it's flanked by plenty of trees that offer a break from the heat. The sand here is at its whitest, and the sea is warm and perfect for swimming. Plus, Tanjong Beach is dog friendly, so you'll often see humans jumping into the water with their canine companions. Need a change of scenery? The Tanjong Beach Club is a major attraction here and the only place on this beach where you'll get food. It offers a swimming pool, deck chairs and cabanas, as well as live music events twice a month.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tanjong+Beach/
151, Siloso Beach,Singapore,"Siloso Beach is where the action is on Sentosa. If your idea of fun in the sand includes things like canoeing, beach volleyball, or even water jet packs, this is where you should be. For dining and shopping options, it also doesn't get much better than Siloso, where you'll find everything from the standard beach eateries offering fast food and pizza to Hawaiian-themed menus, fresh fruits, and even poke bowls. Shopping outlets and cafés are dotted all throughout the coastline, offering plenty of options for when you need a break from the golden sands. Siloso is Singapore's hippest beach, with live music, cafés, and some of the coolest attractions on the island just steps away from the sand. While no sun loungers are allowed on the beach, you can bring a towel and just lie back on the soft sand for a while – though be warned, this isn't the kind of quiet beach where you can just relax with a book. Want the best views around? The nearby MegaZip zipline zooms you over the water and coastline for 450 meters of stunning scenery. There's also a 50-meter-tall bungee jumping tower, rock climbing opportunities, two luge tracks (including one with neon lights you can ride at night), a chair lift ride, and rollerblading options.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Siloso+Beach/
152, Palawan Beach,Singapore,"Of the three sections of Sentosa Beach, Palawan Beach is the most visually famous. It's located right in the middle of the island, at the end of an impressive suspension bridge with viewing towers on each end. Climb all the way up for 360-degree views of the water, the tropical jungle, and the coastline. Then head back to walk on the softest white sand as you hear the swaying palm trees all around you. This is Singapore's best swimming area, with calm, warm blue waters. Palawan is said to be the closest point to the Equator in Asia and is full of photo opportunities. It is walking distance from Tanjong Beach and though it offers more attractions and activities, it's still much more relaxed than lively Siloso. You'll find lots of families here, as well as plenty of solo travelers and couples looking for a place to chill out and have a picnic. When you're ready for some fun, try swimming out to the tiny island near the shore, visit indoor entertainment center KidZania, try the immersive virtual environment at MOSH!, or sit at one of the many oceanfront cafés and restaurants for a mouthwatering meal.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Palawan+Beach/
153, Changi Beach,Singapore,"Changi Beach is part of Changi Beach Park, a 3.3-kilometer-long park with stretches of golden sand popular among the locals. Changi Beach doesn't have the hip, modern look that you'll find on the beaches at Sentosa Island – and that's part of its magic. The area retains the feel of a kampong, a type of traditional floating village common in many parts of Asia. You can get to Changi via the Changi Ferry Terminal, which sits right next to the beach. Although occasional crocodile sightings can be a little daunting, this is still a popular swimming spot. If you prefer to stay safe on land, you'll find plenty of BBQ pits, rental shops for kayaks and canoes, and many restaurants for alfresco dining. Changi is perfect as a lounging beach – people flock here to catch the sunset or to watch low-flying planes heading to the nearby airport. There are plenty of places to camp near the beach, or you can head to the northern tip of Changi to find the area's best resorts. The Sea Sports Club here offers kayaking courses, and you'll find a walkway that connects all the way back to the beach.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Changi+Beach/
154, Punggol Beach,Singapore,"For those wanting to leave hectic Singapore life behind for the day, Punggol Beach will feel like a tropical paradise. The site of the 1942 Sook Ching Massacre and later a very rural area where wild pigs lived, Punggol has been cleaned up and re-imagined over the years. Today, it offers a quiet escape in Northern Singapore, where you can dig your toes into the golden sands or jump into the azure waters for a cool swim. Punggol is a favorite destination for photographers and nature lovers, with the many boulders on the beach offering stunning views as the sun both raises and sets over the water. Just steps from the beach, you'll find Punggol Settlement, an area with many restaurants and eateries, plus places to rent bicycles, explore the fauna and flora at the Lorong Halus Wetlands, and walk along Punggol Promenade (where the Punggol Jetty is located) and Punggol Waterway Park.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Punggol+Beach/
155, St,Singapore,"Singapore's many offshore islands offer plenty of adventure for nature lovers. Luckily for visitors to St. John's Island, that means not only beaches but also caves and mangroves that can be explored on short hikes. St. John's beaches are narrow but golden and soft, with plenty of beautiful coral reefs around. They're a great place to sit back and relax while listening to the waves crashing on the shore. The island is also home to swimming lagoons, picnic grounds, and a rustic vibe that will appeal to those wishing for a quieter getaway. St. John's was once known as ""cat island"" because of the many free-roaming cats that inhabited it. Over the past few years, however, a successful trap-neuter-return-program headed by the SPCA has reduced the population to a manageable number that's now watched over by dedicated caretakers. St. John's can only be visited as a day trip, since there are no accommodations on the island. The one exception is for renters of the Holiday Bungalow, a single property that can be shared by up to 10 people. To get to the island, you'll have to catch a ferry from Singapore's main Marina South Pier. The last boat back leaves at 5 to 6pm depending on the day of the week, so make sure you don't miss it if you don't have accommodations on the island. There's no food available for sale on the island either – if you have a picnic in mind, make sure you bring your own food.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/St/
156, Lazarus Island,Singapore,"Connected to St. John's Island by a bridge, Lazarus Island is a well-kept secret and one of the most private beaches in Singapore. It's just a few minutes' walk from the bridge to the C-shaped lagoon and one of the whitest soft beaches around. Especially during weekdays, the tranquil beach is almost always deserted and perfect for a stroll or a swim in the clear blue waters. Lazarus is popular for picnics, too. It offers plenty of shade in the form of coconut trees lining up the beach and a rain shelter for the occasional afternoon downpour. There are no facilities on the island (no food or accommodation available and no toilets), so anybody visiting should bring anything they need for the day. With no entertainment options available and no development anywhere to be seen, visitors arriving on Lazarus Island can focus on sunbathing, swimming in the clear waters, and taking walks on the beach.

157, East Coast Beach,Singapore,"Singapore's largest park stretches for 15 kilometers right against the ocean in the southeastern coast. Like in most of Singapore, the beach here is man-made, built on reclaimed land, and offers plenty of sunbathing spots. The massive size of the park means there's plenty of space for visitors to kayak, windsurf, and swim in their own corner, away from the crowds. Arrive in the early morning, and you'll find tai chi classes on the beach and plenty of people in silent contemplation at Bedok Jetty, which looks out over the calm blue waters. Cycle and walking paths, plenty of oceanfront restaurants, camping sites and BBQ pits make this a great weekend destination, which means it's better to arrive during the week if you want peace and quiet. Sit under the swaying coconut palms and you can easily forget that a bustling metropolis is just minutes away. Xtreme SkatePark, cable skiing, and cycling circuits are available for those who want a more active getaway. There's no shortage of cafés in the area, either, and the park even offers shower activities for a quick rinse off after a day playing in the sand.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/East+Coast+Beach/
158, Pulau Ubin Island,Singapore,"Pulau Ubin was once a very active granite quarry, but as the industry slowed down in the area, tourists started to arrive for other reasons. The island is part of the Ubin—Khatib Important Bird Area (IBA), where many endangered bird species live. Pulau Ubin is also one of the largest (and one of the last) rural areas in Singapore – there's no urban development and no centralized public transportation here, and wooden jetties and villages are more common than cement constructions. The island is just a short boat ride away from Changi Point Ferry Terminal and makes for a perfect day trip. Singapore's last-remaining kampong is here, set among coconut rubber plantations and hiking trails that crisscross through the tropical forest. The beaches at Pulau Ubin are small and remain underdeveloped. They're often hidden among the mangroves, offering privacy, as well as stunning views over the water. The best ones to visit are in the section known as Chek Jawa wetland beaches. Getting here requires transportation or a 40-minute walk from the main port. Chek Jawa has both rocky and sandy beaches, a great swimming lagoon, and a large coastal area covered in forest. There are only basic facilities in the area, so bring your own food if you want to hang around and have a picnic.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pulau+Ubin+Island/
159, Biarritz and the Basque Coast,France,"Biarritz is an elegant beach resort that has drawn high-society holidaymakers since the Belle Epoque.

It is only advised to swim and bathe at Biarritz beaches when lifeguards are on duty. Biarritz is a good base for a seaside holiday in the South of France.

163, Corsica's Plage de Palombaggia,France,"An image of island paradise, the Plage de Palombaggia is prized for its wide swath of soft, fine white sand and crystal-clear aquamarine waters. The scenic drive that leads to this picture-perfect stretch of beach is noteworthy in itself, with enormous red granite rocks and maritime pine trees adding to the coastal scenery. Because Palombaggia Beach is one of Corsica's finest, it can be crowded. Tourists could avoid the crowds by visiting off-season and still enjoy sunny weather and stunning scenery.

A coastal walking path, Le Sentier du Littoral de Tamaricciu, leads from the Plage de Palombaggia to the nearby Plage de Tamaricciu, a white-sand beach shaded by pine and oak trees.

Trouville has an unpretentious air that's felt everywhere, from the shoreline to the traditional fish market. The Marché aux Poissons takes place in the center of town and is surrounded by excellent restaurants that specialize in seafood dishes.

The boats leave directly from the beach here. Most hotels are also happy to help you arrange a trip to Playa Rincón. If you want to go by car and make a full day of it, you may also want to stop off on the way back at the Boca del Diablo (Devil's Mouth) blow hole.

180, Cabarete Beach,Dominican Republic,"Cabarete Beach, running all along the waterfront of Cabarete, is more about atmosphere than turquoise waters. The beach here is lovely and is one of the few in the area that is frequently calm enough for swimmers of all abilities. The shore is also shallow for a considerable distance, making it more appropriate for children than other beaches in this area. But the real draw here is the vibe. Casual but modestly trendy restaurants line the beach, with tables, chairs, patio lights, and lamps set up under thatch-roofed buildings and directly on the sand. You can dine by the stars at some of the quaint seaside restaurants or listen to a band or solo musician in the early evening. A game of volleyball is usually playing out on the beach or soccer balls are being kicked around. The calmer sections of this crescent-shaped beach are often tranquil enough for stand up paddle boarding, but more frequently, beginner windsurfers are practicing their skill a short distance off shore. Unlike beaches on the Caribbean Coast, you don't see powerboats on Cabarete Beach. This is not the type of beach that is dominated by large-scale resorts, and all-inclusive resorts in Cabarete are scarce, however you can find some luxury beachfront hotels along Cabarete Beach.

Backed by palm trees and a few rustic food stands, this coral-colored, soft-sand beach looks out onto the pounding surf of the Atlantic Ocean. Huge waves often roll in here, but calm days do exist, and the section closest to the parking area is somewhat sheltered by a headland. This wide beach stretches out for more than a kilometer, meaning even on busy days you can always find your own patch of sand, and weekdays you may be on your own here. Playa Grande is located on the outskirts of the town of Rio San Juan, but day trips to this beach can be easily organized from Cabarete or Puerto Plata.

Calm, crystal-clear water and white sand make this one of the most enticing beaches in the Dominican, yet it is also one of the least visited.

Boats depart from the small town of Las Galeras; the very last town on the main road through the Samaná Peninsula. If you thought you were at the end of the world when you reached Las Galeras, you won't feel any closer to civilization when you hop in a small boat and head out on the ocean for a 40-minute trip to a forgotten beach. The beach gets the light in the morning, and in the afternoon is shaded by the cliff walls.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Playa+Fronton/
186, Saracen Bay,Cambodia,"To find remote, pristine beaches, some of the best places to visit in Cambodia are the country's islands. One of two sister resort islands off the coast of Sihanoukville, Koh Rong Samloem (the other island is Koh Rong), has some incredible, secluded beaches with a lot of fun things to do. It's a 40-minute ferry ride from the mainland, leaving from Sihanoukville. Saracen Bay was once a sleepy fishing village, and now it's a very cool tourist destination with a few different beach areas. It's popular with younger visitors and couples. There are beachfront accommodations and a small town. There are a few beach resorts here as well. Most have a very laid-back vibe.", Koh Rong Samloem,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Saracen+Bay/
187, M'Pai Bai,Cambodia,"Saracen Bay is growing in tourism popularity (and crowds), and smart travelers seeking more of a personal experience are venturing to the northern side of Koh Rong Samloem island and the village of M'pai Bai. There's a main M'pai Bai village beach fronting M'pai Bay, which is never crowded, and two more beaches in the area, which are normally completely deserted, except for local fishermen. There are no beach resorts or hotels here, only small hostels, beach bungalows, and guest houses. A short hike from the beach leads to two waterfalls, a nice hike to do to escape the heat of the day. When you want more social fun and things to do, it's easy to head south to the Saracen Bay area.", Koh Rong Samloem,https://www.google.com/maps/place/M'Pai+Bai/
188, Otres Beach,Cambodia,"This Cambodian beach is a part of the resort city of Sihanoukville but far enough away to offer a more remote experience. Sihanoukville's Otres Beach is a five-minute moto-taxi ride from downtown or from nearby Ochheuteal Beach (the main tourist beach in the area). The water here is cleaner and clearer, and the beach is fronted by a row of tall casuarina and palm trees instead of resort hotels. Otres Beach accommodations vary from small boutique hotels and independent resorts to family-run beach guesthouses. The beach is divided into two areas, Otres 1 and Otres 2, separated by a resort. Otres 1 is busier and Otres 2, farther down the coast, is less developed. Otres Resort is a boutique hotel, a five-minute walk from Otres 2 beach. The rooms and suites have a cool, Scandinavian minimalist meets Khmer design, and the hotel has a nice pool, small spa, and its own restaurant.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Otres+Beach/
189, Ream Beach,Cambodia,"Ream Beach is a part of Ream National Park, located about 30 minutes from Sihanoukville City. This large nature preserve includes a long stretch of raw beach. There are some fishermen's shacks and a few tiny, family-run beach cafés. There are also covered seating areas with rows of hammocks. Nearby is a mangrove wetlands area. It's a good place to visit to escape the crowds of some of Sihanoukville's busier beaches, especially on weekends or holidays. Although it's a national park, the area is home to a local community of around 5,000 families who work farms or fish (or operate tourist businesses). This beach is close to Sihanoukville Airport for those flying in or out.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ream+Beach/
190, Sner Beach,Cambodia,"Sner Beach is in the province of Koh Kong. It has a different vibe than some of the other beaches in Cambodia, as it's at the southwestern edge of the country's coastline, right next to the border with Thailand. It's one of those cool places to visit in Cambodia where you'll find mostly, if not only, Cambodians enjoying themselves, as it's not a popular destination for international visitors. The beach is never crowded, the water is usually clean and clear, and there are covered sections of hammocks to just relax in. Sner Beach is also a great place to visit for foodies, as you can enjoy extremely fresh seafood, all cooked for you on the beach barbecue pits. There are a few little beach shacks and cafés along the sand.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sner+Beach/
191, Koh Russey,Cambodia,"Koh Russey, also known as Bamboo Island, features a spectacular, mile-long, pristine private beach.

This Cambodian island is home to the luxurious Koh Russey Villas & Resort. One of the best resorts in Cambodia (and part of the Small Luxury Resorts of the World collection), it's all individual villas and pavilions. They have one-, two-, three-, or four bedrooms and are all beautifully designed and furnished. The resort also has a full-service spa and some incredible food as well. Access is via the resort's private ferry, which drops you or picks you up at a dock near Ream. The interior of the island is mainly jungle, which can be explored via footpaths.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Koh+Russey/
192, Kep Beach,Cambodia,"Kep is a large beach town on the southern part of the Cambodian coast, close to Vietnam. The town, also known as Krong Kaeb, has a fun beach area that offers just the right amount of development. It's a raw, remote beach, but the beachfront promenade also has little cafés and some market sections where you can pick out your own fresh seafood and fruit. Kep Beach is known for its amazing, fresh-caught seafood. The area is especially interesting, as Kep was a former French beach resort popular during and after the period of French Colonialism (Cambodia was a protectorate of France from 1863 to 1953). Some of the architecture and wide streets recall the days of French rule. Kep was the epicenter of what was known as the Khmer Riviera in the 1950s and 60s. The beach has vendors renting rafts, boogie boards, umbrellas, and beach chairs. The beach itself was overhauled by the government a few years ago, and massive amounts of sand were brought in from other areas to create a large, recreational beach.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kep+Beach/
193, Koh Ta Kiev,Cambodia,"This idyllic little island, known as KTK, is accessible only by ferry or speedboat. It's about two miles off the shore of Otres Beach. KTK is rapidly seeing a lot of development but is still a beautiful place to enjoy the beach. The island remains remote, and other than the few hotels and resorts here, there are no shops or other places to buy things. The interior of the island is jungle, and there are treehouse-type guesthouse accommodations available. Aside from the guesthouses and overnight accommodations (you can also camp here), Koh Ta Kiev makes a great day trip.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Koh+Ta+Kiev/
194, Koh Tonsay,Cambodia,"Also known as Rabbit Island (due to its shape), this remote and undeveloped beach resort area is just off the south part of the Cambodian coast, near the border with Vietnam. The beaches here are either rather thin and sloping, with coarse brown sand, or wide and flat, with fine white sand. In both cases, they're backed by rows of tall trees. The water is clean and clear, and it's a great beach for swimming and snorkeling. Access is via a 20-minute boat ride from the city of Kep. In addition to its beautiful beaches, the island is a popular spot for fishing. You can go out on a fishing boat for a few hours or just fish off the beach or one of the docks.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Koh+Tonsay/
195, Lonely Beach,Cambodia,"This aptly named beach is on Koh Rong, the sister island to Koh Rong Samoem. It's off the coast near Sihanoukville and takes about 40 minutes to get to by boat. Lonely Beach can be found at the northern tip of the island, away from much of the other resort development. The sea here sometimes glows at night. During certain seasons, the surf is filled with bio-luminescent plankton, which literally glow in the dark. For a seriously remote adventure, try the Lonely Beach Koh Rong resort. The destination is the only one on the northern part of the island, so you have miles of unspoiled beaches virtually all to yourself. The casual, barefoot resort has little bungalows, some of which are right on the beach.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lonely+Beach/
196, Victory Beach,Cambodia,"If you have limited beach time, this beach is close to Sihanoukville City (next to the new port), yet offers a nice, somewhat secluded feel. It has a few beach shacks and other little cafés and tourist businesses renting rafts and umbrellas. There's also a little pier that extends out into the sea, good for fishing or sightseeing. The views can be spoiled by the construction cranes of the nearby port development, but this helps keep the crowds away as well. Victory Beach can be much less crowded than its much more popular and developed neighboring beaches like Serendipity. When you're ready for some food after a day on the sand, walk up from the beach to the cool Victory Hill neighborhood.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Victory+Beach/
197, Serendipity Beach,Cambodia,"Sometimes, like when you are traveling with children or just have a few hours to spare, you want a big beach with lots of facilities and things to eat and do. Serendipity Beach is the largest beach area right at Sihanoukville. Although you won't find peace and privacy here, you will find a huge beach, lifeguards, and gentle surf. You'll also find a long pier, as well as a beachfront area filled with accommodations, shops, and cafés. The beach's proximity to Sihanoukville City means you can also walk a few minutes and have lots more shops and restaurants close by.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Serendipity+Beach/
198, Song Saa Private Island,Cambodia,"This sustainable, ultra-luxury boutique resort is on its own tiny island at Koh Rong and offers a seriously remote, beyond luxurious tropical island resort experience. Not only does it have incredibly beautiful private beaches but it also has some Instagram-worthy, over-the-water villas. These have elements like glass floors or other openings allowing you to see down into the blue-green water below. All the villas are furnished in a modern, luxurious Khmer style, and all have their own private pools of some kind.

199, Koh Totang,Cambodia,"This isolated, remote, barely developed, virtually uninhabited island is the perfect destination to really experience the sheer raw, natural beauty of Cambodia's beaches (it's also got some great snorkeling). The island has no hot running water, electricity only for a few hours a day, and the Nomads Land beachfront eco-bungalows as its only accommodation. Koh Totang is one of 12 little islands that form the Koh S'Dach archipelago. It's far enough away from Sihanoukville to keep the crowds low, but still easy to access within a few hours. The island is about halfway between Sihanoukville and the Thai border, and you can drive here (thanks to a new road) or take a boat.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Koh+Totang/
200, Koh Krabey,Cambodia,"Another essentially private island with a sole resort on it is Koh Krabey. It's home to the Six Senses Krabey Island resort, one of the world's great wellness resorts. Accommodations are 40 freestanding villas, each with their own infinity pool. The sustainable yet sumptuous villas are thoughtfully designed with multiple levels and living roofs. Importantly, the resort boasts an impressive ecological program that aims for zero waste. This includes no disposable plastic, producing their own essential oils and cleaning products and even an on-island desalination plant. The entire design and construction blends into the natural environment. The resort's world-class spa uses products and essential oils produced on-site with their menu of locally inspired massages and treatments.

201, Tossa de Mar,Spain,"Located on the Catalonian coast in northeastern Spain, the Costa Brava area delivers rugged beauty (the name literally means ""rough coast""), with many serene beaches surrounded by high cliffs. Aside from the beaches, it's a great part of Spain for sightseeing, as it's filled with a long history and rich culture. Tossa de Mar is an ancient town, midway between Barcelona and the French border. It has a beautiful, curved beach with a bonus: there's a large castle on the hill beyond the beach. The sand here is coarse and dark golden brown, with a large area of the bay roped off for swimming. Beyond the beautiful beach, attractions in the area include Roman ruins, as well as several nature preserves. The Gran Hotel Reymar & Spa is in the little town of Tossa de Mar, up on the hillside, overlooking the bay. Some of the rooms and suites (try for one on a high floor) have sweeping ocean views.

202, Es Pujols,Spain,"Formentera, Ibiza's neighboring island in Spain's Balearic Islands territory, is far more beautiful and peaceful than fun-loving Ibiza. You can go back and forth between the islands via ferry – the ride takes about 30 minutes. Beaches like Es Pujols offer both bright, white sands and dreamy blue-green water. It's no deserted island – the beach is fronted by a pathway lined with cafés and restaurants, and beyond the beach there's a vibrant little town. The Castavi Apartments are steps from the beach in Es Pujols. The units are large, with full kitchens, and there's an outdoor swimming pool. In addition to its proximity to the beach, it makes a good base for sightseeing around the island. The building has a little snack bar and a front desk with 24-hour staff who can help set up activities and excursions.", Formentera,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Es+Pujols/

Another Spanish territory, these islands are almost 60 miles (95 kilometers) off the coast of Africa, in the Atlantic Ocean. The two main islands are Tenerife and Gran Canaria. Playa del Ingles, on Gran Canaria, is nearly seven miles (11 kilometers) of wide, sandy beach, gradually transforming into beautiful dunes. Once a popular hippy hangout in the 1960s, it's now filled with luxury boutique hotels and foodie restaurants. The beach is golden brown with a gentle slope towards the sea. There are many beach clubs that rent beach chairs and umbrellas and have their own little fenced-off areas. The Hotel Riu Palace Maspalomas overlooks the incredible dunes of Maspalomas (and the ocean beyond), which look like a Martian landscape.

204, Bogatell,Spain,"Barcelona is Spain's second largest city, and it sits right on the Mediterranean coast. The coastline in and around the city is lined with beaches. Bogatell is within the city limits but less crazy than the city's main Barceloneta beach. Bogatell, a man-made beach, was created for the 1992 Olympics, so it's well-designed and clean. There are lifeguards on duty and basic facilities (bathrooms and showers) every few hundred yards along the beach. It's a wide, flat beach with coarse, brown sand. The Ibis Styles Barcelona City Bogatell is a good mid-range choice in the area. It's a 10-minute walk from the sand. Locals also enjoy the beachfront neighborhood of Castelldefels. This beach is 20 minutes by train from downtown Barcelona and right across from a train station. It has miles of wild beach, but still plenty of tapas places and beach shacks for food.

205, Cala Mesquida,Spain,"Another of the Balearic Islands (like Ibiza), Mallorca is the largest and most developed. Despite its popularity and development, it's still possible to find some hidden beach gems. Cala Mesquida is on the northeast coast and just starting to be discovered by international tourists. The small bay has a quarter-mile-long beach with fine sand. There are chair and umbrella rentals but only one restaurant and one snack stand. Showers and bathrooms are also available, but no changing areas. Beyond the beach there's a small town. Located in the hills above the little town, the VIVA Suites & Spa is an adults-only (over 16) upscale boutique resort. The resort focuses on wellness, with a nicely appointed spa and a very healthy menu. The hotel is a bit isolated, perfect for those seeking a more peaceful, private experience.", Mallorca,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cala+Mesquida/
206, Almunecar,Spain,"Pass up the resorts on the crowded Costa del Sol and head to the next part of the coastline, the Costa Tropical. There's a much better mix of development and preservation of natural beauty. The primary resort is Almunecar, which feels like a seaside town in the South of France. There's a long, curving beach fronted by a promenade and street lined with shops, restaurants, and hotels. There is also a row of mainly restaurants along the beach itself. The beach has soft white sand, and the water, especially in the summer, is quite warm. There are many places to rent beach chairs and umbrellas with private beach club areas fenced off.

This Spanish beach is accessible by car, although parking can be difficult during the summer. You can walk here from the village of Niembro (park here). Aside from the beaches, Asturias is a great region for sightseeing, as it was an important part of both medieval and Moorish Spain. The Hotel Miracielos is close to Niembro in Barro, which has a few nice beaches of its own. This family-friendly hotel is on a green hillside, overlooking just one of the many small beach coves in the area. The stylish, newly-built hotel offers rooms and suites with full kitchens and furnished balconies.", Asturias,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Playa+de+Torimbia/

Close to Almeria, the resort town of Carboneras is known for its beautiful beaches, which are surrounded by a huge nature preserve. The area is also known for its food, mainly fresh seafood. There are a few beach areas around the bay, which extends quite far into the land. Beaches in front of the hotel have beach chair and umbrella rentals, but a more natural experience can be found just by walking a few minutes down the sand. The water is warm, and the sand here is tan and slopes down towards the waterline. The beach is bordered by palm trees and raised dunes, topped with a beachfront walkway. The Hotel CH Cabo de Gata is a modern hotel located on the hillside in Carboneras overlooking the sea. Rooms and suites all have furnished balconies or patios with sea views. The hotel is named for and close to the Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park. The park is filled with a lot of volcanic geologic formations and a large area of salt flats.", Almeria,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Carboneras/
210, Benicassim,Spain,"Benicassim is known as Spain's music beach and deserves a mention if only for its huge, annual music festival. The multi-day concert, held on the beach, attracts several hundred thousand people each July, along with the top names in the music business. The city itself is a modern, Mediterranean resort, with wide, sweeping beaches and a highly developed beachfront promenade. Torreon Beach is a peaceful, laid-back section, perfect for relaxing in the sun. All the beaches in Benicassim are very wide, stretching several hundred yards to the waterline at low tide. They're also very flat. The Thalasso Hotel Termas Marinas El Palasiet is a boutique resort hotel on a hill overlooking the city. The spa hotel is a five-minute walk from the sea and offers an extensive thalassotherapy treatment menu.

One of the most historic cities in Spain, Cadiz offers amazing sightseeing, along with miles of wide beaches. The beach region in Andalusia including Cadiz is referred to as the Costa de la Luz (the ""coast of light""). La Playa de la Victoria is the city's most popular beach. It's about a mile (2.5 kilometers) long and a few hundred yards wide. The surf is calm, and the beach and sea are not rocky, so it's good for swimming and wading. There's a small street that separates the beach from a row of stores and places to eat. The popular beach can be quite crowded during the summer months but has a vibrant energy that makes it a fun place to visit. The Hotel Playa Victoria is a resort hotel right on the sand.

212, Playa de As Catedrais,Spain,"While some beaches may have a beautiful sandy shoreline or stunning ocean vistas, Playa de As Catedrais in Ribadeo has some of the most stunning rock formations anywhere in the world. The beach is about eight kilometers from the town of Ribadeo, in Galicia, on the northwest tip of Spain. The beach is wide and flat, but there are giant rock arches forming the skeleton of a natural cathedral. The name Playa de As Catedrais means ""beach of the cathedrals.""

213, Playa de Silencio,Spain,"As its name implies (the ""beach of silence"") the Playa de Silencio provides a quiet, wild, unspoiled beach experience. It's in the Asturias region, near the town of Cudillero. The beach gets its name from the natural rock amphitheater that surrounds the entire beachfront area. The rock formation blocks almost all the wind and makes the beach very peaceful, quiet, and serene. The beach is a long, gently curving cove of silver-colored sand. Underwater rocks make the area unsafe for swimming, but you can wade into the water and relax on the sand. This is a raw, natural beach with no facilities of any kind. The beach is reached via a rather steep path, keeping the crowds small most of the year.", Asturias,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Playa+de+Silencio/
214, Playa de Ses Illetes,Spain,"Spain's only pink-sand beach is Playa de Ses Illetes on the Balaeric island of Formentera (which is next to Ibiza). The sand here is fine, with a light pink hue caused by tiny pieces of coral washed in by the tide. The name means ""beach of the small islands,"" and there are several small islands in the bay across from the beach. The bay is almost completely encircled by land, so it turns into a giant swimming pool. The water is shallow, and you can walk quite far out into the bay. Getting there is easy; they have a parking lot for cars and scooters, or you can take a taxi. You can also take the public bus that stops nearby. To protect the beach's beauty and environment, access is limited, and there are guards who monitor the number of beachgoers. On popular summer days, there can be a line to get in, so arrive very early. Beyond the beach, Formentera is considered the most bohemian of the Balearic Islands, a culture which is constantly being replaced by luxury resorts and vacation properties. It's well worth a visit and has kind of a laid-back Caribbean vibe. Bring your own food, as the two restaurants at the beach are quite expensive.", Formentera,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Playa+de+Ses+Illetes/
215, Las Arenas,Spain,"With the launch of Spain's AVE bullet train service between Madrid and Valencia in 2010, day trips to the beach from Madrid became a reality. You can leave Madrid's Atocha station and be on Las Arenas beach in Valencia within two hours (you need to take a taxi or bus from the train station to the beach). Las Arenas is Valencia's main public beach, located about a mile from the city center. It's a huge, wide beach that mainly sees locals rather than tourists. You can rent umbrellas and sun loungers. The beach has lifeguards, volleyball courts, and basic services (restrooms and outdoor showers). The large and luxurious Las Arenas Balneario Resort overlooks the beach should you want to spend the night in style. There are also a lot of budget hotels close to the beach.

216, Calo Des Mort,Spain,"One of the most beautiful beaches in Spain, located on the island of Formentera, is cursed by its small size. The sheer beauty of Calo des Mort, despite being accessible only via a crumbling rock staircase with a rope handrail, means it can be crowded. Calo Des Mort is primal, with no services or amenities, but the physical beauty of the spot is worth the trouble to get here. The varying colors of the water, from deep dark blue to light aqua green and turquoise are stunning. This beach also becomes a big swimming pool, as the bay is shallow and it's almost completely protected by rocks from the ocean.", Formentera,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Calo+Des+Mort/
217, Petite Anse,Seychelles,"Arguably the most beautiful Seychelles beach, Petite Anse is both pristine and isolated. Backed by an impressively dense forest and granite cliffs, this gem is located on the southwest coast of Mahé, the largest, and main, island of the Seychelles. A protected bay of silver-tinged sand, this beautiful spot is an excellent place to swim and snorkel, especially for families. The easiest way to gain access to this exclusive beach is by staying at the luxurious Four Seasons Resort Seychelles. Tree house villas equipped with private pools pepper the granite hillside, offering unbeatable views of Petite Anse Bay. They've been designed to blend in with the spectacular background, so your view won't be impeded. Insider's Tip: If you aren't staying at the Four Seasons, plan to arrive early, as parking is sparse. Then, prepare yourself for a 20-minute hike down (and a more arduous uphill journey back). Check in with hotel security, and if you're lucky, a member of the resort staff might let you hitch a ride to the beach.", Mahé,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Petite+Anse/
218, Anse Georgette,Seychelles,"Exceptionally soft, white sand stretches along the shore of the quiet Anse Georgette beach on Praslin Island. Although technically a public beach, Anse Georgette is most easily accessed through the resort, Constance Lemuria. Unlike the Four Seasons Resort at Mahé, which welcome beach visitors if they've checked in with security, the Constance Lemuria limits non-resort guests. By asking visitors to call ahead and reserve a beach visit, they're able to keep the area clean and uncrowded and enhance the beach's secluded allure. Once you arrive at the resort, you can hop on a buggy, which runs every hour from the hotel, or walk a short distance to this impeccable spot. Once here, you'll be greeted by a spectacular bay, featuring water that's the most enticing shade of turquoise. With no rocks or coral to mark the ocean floor off this beach, the ocean is unblemished and extremely inviting. Beware, though, as currents are known to be strong here, so swimming isn't as safe as it is in other locations. Insider's Tip: There's no resort parking available for beach visitors. If you'd like to park on the property, book a table for lunch or dinner.", Praslin,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Anse+Georgette/
219, Anse La Passe,Seychelles,"A remarkable beach hugging the Western shore of Silhouette Island (about 19 kilometers north of Mahé), Anse La Passe is part of the luxurious, all-villa Hilton Seychelles Labriz Resort & Spa. The third largest of the Seychelles archipelago, Sihouette Island is free from cars and is home to only about 100 people. If you're looking for a quiet beach vacation, you'll find it in this utopia. The warm ocean surrounding this island is a protected marine park boasting an untouched paradise teeming with underwater life. Crystal-clear, calm water laps the pristine stretch of sand at Anse La Passe. And a thriving coral reef lies a mere 200 meters offshore, making this a perfect spot for families. When the tide is out, you merely have to wade in ankle deep to experience an exhilarating scene. From lionfish to sting rays to eels, you can see everything without the aid of a snorkel and mask. Beware where you step: spiky sea urchins lie among the coral. Located so close to the resort, other fun activities, like sailing, biking, and fishing, are available, as is delicious food from multiple restaurants. Insider's Tip: Anse La Passe isn't the only remarkable beach on this island. Hop on one of the resort's bikes and make your way past the hilltop spa to another secluded beach peppered with large boulders. Then, hike through the Anse Mondon trail through a rainforest of vanilla, cinnamon, and rare Coco de Mer palm trees. It takes about three hours and ends at the spectacular Anse Mondon beach, a perfect spot to enjoy a dip or snorkel in the Indian Ocean. Hiking shoes are a must!", Silhouette Island,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Anse+La+Passe/
220, Anse Major,Seychelles,"A hidden gem on the northwest coast of Mahé, Anse Major can only be accessed by foot or boat. No roads lead to this secluded nirvana, so you'll have to park and hike in, which can take anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes. The reward: dramatic views of an impeccable coast from atop a granite cliff and a tranquil scene you'll be hard-pressed to beat. Not a walker? Water taxis are also available. Once your feet meet the plush, unspoiled sand, you'll realize your trek was worth it. The region's famed turquoise water caresses the shore, which is embraced by a verdant green jungle. A perfect spot for an enjoyable swim, the calm ocean makes this one of the island's safest places to take a dip. Insider's Tip: Head to the beach in the morning (before 9) to avoid the hot sun, as there's little shade offered on the trail. Also, be sure to pack plenty of water, snacks, and everything else you need for the beach, as there are no amenities here.", Mahé,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Anse+Major/
221, Anse Intendance,Seychelles,"Like most of the impressive Seychelles beaches, Anse Intendance is revered for its iridescent azure water and surrounding lush tropical forest. The one thing missing is a coral reef, but this deficit is in fact a bonus–no reef means excellent surfing. While typically beautiful and serene, Anse Intendance isn't the island's best beach option for families. The rough waves and currents that gratify surfers make swimming difficult for both the younger set and other, less confident swimmers, especially during June to September. Located on the south western coast of Mahé, this wild strand plays host to the exclusive Banyan Tree Seychelles, a romantic beach resort, where holiday guests are treated to private pool villas in a dreamlike locale. It's set well-back, however, making it an unobtrusive addition to the coastline. Plus, the hotel's convenient location is a plus for sunbathers looking for a bite to eat–there are no shops or other concessions available on this secluded beach.", Mahé,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Anse+Intendance/
222, Anse Source d'Argent,Seychelles,"Anse Source d'Argent is literally the face of paradise. Made famous in films and advertising campaigns, this unique spot embodies the true essence of a dream beach vacation. Once you catch sight of its flawless white sand, inimitable boulders, and crystalline tropical water, you'll see why. So, too, do many other vacationers, which is why the beach gets crowded at times, especially during December, January, and August. There is an upside to the beach's popularity: palm shade huts have cropped up, as well as a local stand that sells juices, coconuts, and other refreshing treats. If you're looking for a quieter experience, walk along the path through the giant boulders to the south, away from the main part of the beach. This area is much less crowded and just as spectacular. Another bonus: the water at Anse Source d'Argent is so clear you won't need a snorkel or mask to see the vibrant fish swimming about, and it's shallow and calm enough to entice young children to splash and play. We'd advise wearing water shoes to protect your feet from sharp coral. Insider's Tip: Avoid high tide, when the beach can disappear below the vibrant water. Also, you'll have to pay an entrance fee to the L'Union Estate of SCR. To get to the beach, you'll have to walk through the L'Union Estate park. Your fee includes admission to the park, as well as the museum, which features giant turtles and coconut mills.", La Digue,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Anse+Source+d'Argent/
223, Anse Lazio,Seychelles,"One of the top beaches on Praslin, the second biggest island in the Seychelles, Anse Lazio is enveloped by tall and lush takamaka and palm trees, offering much needed shade from the beating sun. The ocean here is as glassy and transparent as it is at other top-rated Seychelles beaches, and the pristine sugar-white sand makes it one of the island's cleanest beaches. One of the best places to visit for those looking for both a romantic beach vacation and a family holiday to remember, Anse Lazio can get crowded, especially later in the day. It's best to arrive early (around 9) to beat the rush and find a close parking spot. If you have enough time (and energy) to stay late, the sunset here is unbeatable. Insider's Tip: Swimming and snorkeling are two of the most popular activities, especially when the waves are small and calm. That said, the undertow can become intense from June to September, so take care if swimming during this time.", Praslin,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Anse+Lazio/
224, Anse Louis,Seychelles,"Like most of the best Seychelles beaches, Anse Louis has been claimed by a holiday resort. Inconspicuous villas of the impressive Anatara Maia Seychelles Villas dot the lush hillside, all boasting a private infinity pool. That's a bonus for other travelers: hotel guests are so busy enjoying the lap of luxury, you won't have to fight crowds at this lovely, clean beach. Located on Mahé's west coast, Anse Louis is set in a small, sheltered bay, which helps add to the exclusive allure. It covers 500 meters of beachfront and is conveniently situated between two other lovely beaches–Anse à la Mouche and Anse Boileau. On the north end of the beach, you'll find the large, granite rocks made famous by this region, as well as a tropical forest begging to be discovered. The south end is best for lounging and swimming, while you'll find larger surf-worthy waves to the north side. From June to September, you can expect seaweed to wash into shore. Insider's Tip: Public access to this beach is simple. Merely park in the nearby lot (just south of the resort) or grab a taxi or hop on a local bus.", Mahé,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Anse+Louis/
225, West Beach,Seychelles,"West Beach is an oasis of pearly sand that softly caresses weary feet. One of the Seychelles' best beaches to watch a sunset, this Bird Island sanctuary offers a breathtaking vista filled with unbeatable hues of orange, red, pink, and purple. Talk about a remote beach! Situated 96 kilometers from Mahé, this strand is located on the northernmost island in the Seychelles archipelago. It's so quiet and remote that even turtles feel brave enough to wander the area and lay their eggs. Protected on its east and west sides by a barrier reef, Bird Island is a perfect place to get up close and personal with the underwater life. Head to nearby Hirondelle Beach for the best snorkeling. The island is also well known for its vibrant bird life, hence the name. In fact, close to one million Sooty Terns call Bird Island home. Insider's Tip: Book a night at the Bird Island villa-only resort, since the only way to get to Bird Island is by plane (a 30-minute flight from Mahé), and they leave only once a day. Don't expect room service, air conditioning, phones, or television. This rustic hotel is designed to get you back to nature and away from the annoying habits we've picked up in the modern world. That's something we could all benefit from.", Bird Island,https://www.google.com/maps/place/West+Beach/
226, Grand Anse,Seychelles,"A picture-perfect beach that's free from crowds, Grand Anse is a wonderful place to spend a day frolicking under the sun. The sand here is so soft, you'll feel as if you're walking through powder instead of ground-up pieces of coral. The longest beach on La Digue, Grand Anse is impeccable in its beauty, edged by spectacular granite boulders and backed by leaning palm trees. The only downside is that their shade doesn't reach the sand. That means there's no real respite from the midday heat. Grand Anse is known to most as a wild beach. Instead of quiet, calm waves gently lapping the shore, you're more likely to encounter a rough, crashing surf that reminds you of who's really in charge—Mother Nature. This is great news for surfers, who can spend hours on these windswept waters. Swimmers should use extra caution, especially during the southeast monsoon season between April and October. Insider's Tip: Most visitors bike uphill to this lovely beach. Reward yourself with a cool drink from the beach shack–this is also one of the only areas where you'll find shade.", La Digue,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Grand+Anse/
227, Beau Vallon Bay,Seychelles,"The view at Beau Vallon Bay is the stuff dreams are made of. Drooping palms wave in greeting above a long stretch of silver, soft sand while offering a shady retreat. One of the largest beaches on Mahé, Beau Vallon is peppered with beach hotels, restaurants, and other shops. The downside: this makes the beach seem a bit more commercialized than a top Seychelles beach should be, but the crowds are luckily kept at bay. A family-friendly spot, Beau Vallon offers some of the safest swimming on the island. Since the tide goes in and out slowly and there are few waves, it's an easy place to wade in and splash around with kids. This is also one of the best places to participate in beach activities. From parasailing to paddleboarding to banana boating, there's no lack of things to do at Beau Vallon. Insider's Tip: Head to the beach at sunset to enjoy a truly miraculous view. In the distance, you'll catch sight of the beautiful Silhouette Island.", Mahé,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Beau+Vallon+Bay/
228, Anse Forbans,Seychelles,"If you're looking for a place to relax, Anse Forbans is it. Shallow, calm, and vibrant turquoise water make this beach an ideal place for families, romantics, and those looking to chill out. While swimming and sunbathing are the main pastimes, many enjoy snorkeling and fishing around the calm bay. Located along Mahé's southeast coast, Anse Forbans has also fallen prey to beach hotels like the four-star Doubletree by Hilton Seychelles - Allamanda Resort and Spa. That's not necessarily a bad, thing, though, as it means you'll be able to find restaurants, accommodation, and access to water sports nearby. Despite its proximity to the hotels, this beach never feels too crowded. In fact, you can often have it almost to yourself. Insider's Tip: Nature has divided this calm bay into three smaller sections of beach, with the use of large granite boulders. During low tide, you can search the natural pools for sea creatures, or, swim and snorkel through the lagoon formed by an offshore reef.", Mahé,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Anse+Forbans/
229, Anse St,Seychelles,"A small beach (it's about 600 meters long) on the south coast of Praslin, this little piece of paradise offers visitors a break from the hustle and bustle of larger, more popular beaches. Lined with sweeping coconut palms, this beach is well photographed, and appreciated, for its shade-giving trees. The warm, calm water here is shallow, with no large surf to contend with, making it a family-friendly beach worth visiting. These attributes also make Anse St. Sauveur an ideal spot to head out for a snorkeling adventure close to shore–no boat needed. It's also a good spot to fish. Insider's Tip: The beach's small size is a plus, since most visitors come to take selfies with the magnificent trees and leave shortly after. They're likely looking for a place with more space to spread out while spending an entire day seaside. That leaves plenty of clean sand available for your own lounging needs. Visitors to Anse St. Sauveur are rewarded with an impeccable view of the Seychelles' main island, Mahé.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Anse+St/
230, Anse Volbert,Seychelles,"The most popular and longest beach on Praslin, Anse Volbert has been deemed the Seychelles' Cote d'Or. A hot spot for beachgoers, this strand is a great place to find all sorts of water activities, including windsurfing, scuba diving, fishing, and sailing. Another bonus: the water here is calm and shallow, especially during low tide, which makes it ideal for those traveling with kids. Drooping palms will protect you from the sun's intense rays while providing a fun place for little ones to climb and jump. You can also rent an umbrella. If you're looking for a meal or need to top up your sunblock, you won't have to go far; small shops and restaurants line the road behind this lovely beach. Insider's Tip: Anse Volbert is a popular starting point for multiple day cruises and other excursions. This may partly be due to the beach's close proximity to the road and bus stop. It's an easy place to get to.", Praslin,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Anse+Volbert/
231, Anse Cocos,Seychelles,"Visiting Anse Cocos beach is one of the best things to do on La Digue Island. Once you catch sight of its postcard-worthy beauty, you'll understand why. Gargantuan granite boulders pepper the shimmering white sand, contrasted perfectly by water so blue, you'd swear Crayola was responsible for coloring it. As is the case with most things worth doing, a visit to Anse Cocos requires a bit of effort. In this case, that means a 30-minute walk from nearby Grand Anse beach. Its secluded locale means you won't need to fight crowds, however, which is a lovely treat for those looking for a little romance and isolation with their beach vacay. Search the tide pools near the base of the boulders for unique wildlife; paddle about in the calm, shallow water at the end of the bay; or merely laze on the soft sand while gazing out at a view so gorgeous, it will melt any stress. When you're feeling overheated, head to the waves or nestle under a palm tree for a bit of a respite. Insider's tip: While the natural, boulder-formed swimming pool at the end of the bay is calm, the rest of the area can boast dangerous tides and current. Be careful, especially since there are few, if any, other visitors to this beach.", La Digue,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Anse+Cocos/
232, Anse Marron,Seychelles,"Another masterpiece found on La Digue, Anse Marron boasts the immaculate sand and crystalline turquoise water we dream about on cold, dreary days at home. It's also the proud placeholder for multiple giant granite boulders that provide not only an Instagram-worthy backdrop but also a fantastic spot to watch crabs mosey their way along the sand and rock. Picturesque boulders provide natural, calm saltwater pools, perfect for less confident swimmers to splash about and float safely at this southernmost of the island's beaches. Note: The water drops off quickly as you leave the protection of the boulders, so beware. A well-hidden gem, this beach can be tricky to find, and requires a bit of a hike that can be rocky and slippery, so it is not the best spot to bring kids. It is, however, a wonderful place to escape and luxuriate in an unbeatable type of solitude. We'd suggest hiring a guide if you don't want to get lost. If the water's calm enough and you have access to a boat, this is another option for reaching Anse Marron.", La Digue,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Anse+Marron/
233, Ostend Beaches,Belgium,"The beaches at Ostend are among the most popular resort destinations in Europe, famous for high-end spas and luxury accommodations. Ostend is also very popular as a day trip from Bruges, only 30 minutes by rail, with trains leaving every half hour. Ostend's beaches are also known for their annual events, like the Sculpture Festival and the Theater aan Zee (TAZ) Festival, which occupies multiple locations in a celebration of culture. As a major port town, Ostend also welcomes a great deal of visitors from the United Kingdom. There are six separate beach areas in Ostend, totaling seven kilometers in length and averaging 80 meters wide. The Albert I Promenade is four kilometers long, starting along the interior of the Voorhaven harbor canal behind the Klein Strand (Small Beach). From here, it wraps around and extends west behind the city's most populated beaches. There is no swimming allowed at Klein Strand, but it is often used as the setting for events and festivals. Groot Strand (Large Beach) in Ostend Groot Strand (Large Beach) is, as its name implies, one of the longest Ostend beaches at two kilometers. It is also the most crowded, with the shops and restaurants concentrated along its western end. There are full facilities here, including restrooms, changing areas, and plenty of vendors with beach supplies. The Koninklijke Gaanderijen (Royal Galleries) sit at the western end, a stunning historic structure that is an attraction in its own right. Sportstrand (Sports Beach) picks up after the Royal Galleries, still flanked by the promenade. This section of beach is one of the most impressive in the world, designed specifically with the needs and interests of active beachgoers in mind. There are volleyball nets, a climbing wall, picnic tables, and plenty of space to play beach sports. The westernmost end is reserved for surfing and kite flying, and also has a convenient drop-off area for those who brought their own equipment. Next to Sports Beach is Mariakereke Beach, a 2.4-kilometer stretch of sand that is much less crowded than its neighbors. It has fewer amenities, mostly used by residents living nearby. Raversijde Beach is the westernmost and by far the most peaceful along the main stretch of sand. It is also a stop on the Coastal Tram, making it easily accessible to beach hoppers. Oosterstrand (Eastern Beach) sits at the opposite end near Fort Napoleon, separated from the other beaches by the wide harbor. This 1.2-kilometer stretch of sand is much quieter than the rest, accessible in parts by a paved path through the dunes.

234, Knokke-Heist Beaches,Belgium,"The easternmost of Belgium's beaches, the municipality of Knokke-Heist borders the Netherlands along the edge of Zwin Nature Park. There are actually four beaches here, totaling 12 kilometers of white sand and grassy dunes. The two most popular beaches are Het Zoute (""the salt"") and Albertstrand, both home to high-end luxury resorts. Duinbergen Beach and Heist Beach have more relaxed atmospheres and are more popular with locals and families. Het Zoute is the easternmost of the beaches, abutting the nature park, and stretches for two kilometers of coastline, reaching 150 meters wide in some places. This is where you will find the most exclusive resorts and private residences, as well as the most expensive art galleries and restaurants. Neighboring Albertstrand is home to the more boisterous luxury resorts where you will find endless entertainment just steps from the beach. There is a fireworks festival held here each year, and the local yacht club can be found at the western end of the beach. The more family-friendly Duinbergen Beach picks up at the yacht club and extends about one kilometer to the dunes at Directeur-Generaal Willemspark, the area's last remaining intact dunes. This is Knokke-Heist's least developed section, most popular with locals. On the other side of the dunes, Heist Beach is the widest, at an average of 270 meters, and extends 1.6 kilometers until it meets the port at Zeebrugge. This area is more developed, offering a good variety of amenities to beachgoers. Tourists can find sightseeing cruises, charters, and ferries to the United Kingdom at the adjacent port.

235, Blankenberge,Belgium,"One of Belgium's top resort towns, Blankenberge is best known for its activity-filled promenade known as the Zeeddjik. Just 18 kilometers from Bruges, this beach can be crowded on hot days, adding to the lively atmosphere. Resorts line the waterfront, some of which have gated sections for guests, while many others offer seaside dining for the general public.

Visitors who want to explore beyond the sand will find plenty of things to do, including an excellent aquarium at Sea Life Blankenberge. There is also a lovely Gothic church, Sint-Antoniuskerk, that was built in the 1350s. Accommodation: Where to Stay in Blankenberge", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Blankenberge/
236, Zeebrugge Beach,Belgium,"Zebrugge's beach sits west of the port and extends to Oostende, totaling approximately 20 kilometers long and an average of 70 meters wide at high tide. The beach has a combination of dunes and flat sand, and the more central portions can get very crowded in the summer thanks to its proximity to Bruges. Those driving to Zebrugge on a day trip from Bruges will be relieved to find plenty of free parking near the beach. Surfing is a popular sport here, as are kiteboarding and windsurfing.

After the colorful boats dock, walk to the auction hall where the fishermen sell the day's catch. This is one of the largest fish markets in Europe. If you like sweet more than salty, make your way to the local chocolate factory, P&J Chocolates-a Belgian, where you can get a tour and plenty of fine goodies to take home. Zebrugge is also well-known for its historical significance during World War I, formerly serving as a port for German U-boats until the base was taken out in 1918. There is a St. George's Day memorial at the site. The Seafront Maritime Theme Park also delves into the port's history, as well as its cultural traditions surrounding the fishing industry.

Several of the larger resorts offer excursions as well, including sightseeing cruises and even water skiing. While the main section of the beach has a patterned brick promenade that gives way directly to the sand, the western half of the beach is hidden from view by grassy dunes and has far fewer people. Access points are more limited, but the peace and quiet on this part of the beach is unparalleled. Those exploring this section should remember that swimming is not permitted without lifeguards present, so this is a better area for walking and sunbathing. The area around the beach is also lovely for exploring, and cycling is a popular activity along the scenic dunes.

This is a popular beach for water sports, especially windsurfing, and visitors will find plenty of places to rent equipment for the day.

Traveling south from the Zona Romantica along Highway 200 reveals a snaking stretch of coastline with stunning, photoshoot-worthy beaches. Among the best can be found along Cabo Corrientes.

Speaking of development, the latest One&Only resort to open in Mexico has opened along the Riviera Nayarit, and features Playa Canalan on its grounds. Though technically all beaches in Mexico are public, it would be difficult to get to this resort if you are not a guest or a customer of the beachfront Italian restaurant on-site.

But it's also known for another peculiar attraction: Batu Malin Kundang, a curious rock formation that looks like a kneeling man. According to a Southeast Asian folktale, a poor sailor snuck aboard a merchant ship and amassed his own fortune. Upon returning to his home village, he felt ashamed at his humble roots and shunned his aging mother. She cursed him – turning his body and ship to stone, which is now here on Air Mains Beach.

There's a beach for everyone on Nusa Penida. Head to secluded Kelingking Beach for incredible photo ops of a famous cliff that looks like an open-mouthed Tyrannosaurus Rex jutting out into the sea.

Besides getting a moment of respite, tourists also seek out this beach for its graffiti-covered shipwreck, which has become famous on social media. Be sure to bring some water and food if you plan to stay a while–this beach doesn't have the kind of development and services you may be used to seeing elsewhere in Bali. After you've had your fill of sun and sand, drive roughly two kilometers northeast to visit another popular attraction in Bali: Uluwatu Temple.

Its dramatic location, squeezed between soaring and jagged cliff faces, has made this little patch of shingle beach world famous. To get here, beachgoers either have to walk down the long, 200-step staircase from the coastal highway above, or arrive by boat from either Kalkan or Kaş. Kaputaş is most striking when seen from the sea, making boat trips here the preferable way to arrive. In summer, get here early, as it can get crammed with sunseekers.

Unlike many of Turkey's beach resorts, Çıralı has eschewed major development and favors guesthouses and low-lying small hotels rather than mega-resorts. This ensures a low-key atmosphere that remains focused on relaxing on the beach. If you do fancy exploring farther than the sand, though, the ruins of the ancient Lycian city of Olympos sit on the far southern end of the beach, while in the evening, you can hike up Mt.

The summer action centers on the village of Alaçatı, where gourmet dining and café culture keep a fashionable crowd busy when sunbathing is done for the day. The Çesme Peninsula's beach scene was originally known for its windsurfing, and the area is still Turkey's number one windsurfing spot. These days, though, most people are here for the more relaxing pursuit of beach slothing. Beaches range from Alaçatı's Windsurfing Beach, where it's all about water sports, and local operators offer windsurfing and kitesurfing lessons and equipment rental, to exclusive beach club beaches, which host live music and other events during peak season, though often don't have much actual sand, to the long swath of soft white sand at Ilica Beach on the seafront of Çesme Town.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Çesme+Peninsula/

Most visitors stop here as part of a boat day trip from Fethiye. During summer, there are also regular shuttle boats running to and from Ölüdeniz. The only other way to access Butterfly Valley is by a tough and sweaty hike from the tiny settlement of Faralya on the clifftop above. For nature lovers, Butterfly Valley has more up its sleeve than sun, sea, and sand. The valley garnered its name from the Jersey Tiger butterflies that are endemic here. If you feel like a stroll and some butterfly spotting, there are lovely walks through the valley beyond the beach.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Butterfly+Valley/

286, Iztuzu Beach,Turkey,"As famous for its annual loggerhead turtle visitors as its sand, Iztuzu is a long arc of soft sand beach running for just under five kilometers. All that room is a good thing, as this is a favorite stop for day trippers on boat tours from Marmaris, as well as being the main beach for the tourists staying in the little town of Dalyan, 10 kilometers to the north. Iztuzu's protected status as a nature site has saved it from development. There's a beach café dishing up good food, plenty of sun-shades and sun-loungers for rent and kayaks for hire, but no hotels or other resort facilities near the sand. This gives the beach a tranquil, old-fashioned vibe. Beachgoers must also be aware of the beach's restricted areas, so they don't stray into turtle nesting areas, and nobody is allowed onto the sand after dark.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Iztuzu+Beach/

The crowds, particularly on beaches close to Marmaris such as Turunc Beach and Içmeler Beach, can get crammed in summer, so it's well worth making the effort to travel farther west for a less sardine-like experience. If you're not on a package holiday, head to Akyaka (on the Bozburun Peninsula), which is home to small guesthouses rather than big resorts. Both Akyaka Beach in the center and Çinar Beach just a short hop to the west are good for sunbathing and swimming, while Akpinar Beach nearby is devoted to kitesurfing.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bozburun+&+Datça+Peninsulas/
288, Kabak,Turkey,"Sitting above a small patch of sand, secreted within the forest-clad slopes of the Yedi Buran Cape, Kabak is Turkey's bohemian beach resort. A stay here is all about sleeping amid the pine trees in the rustic-chic cabins or tee-pees of the intimate camps, with their stunning views down onto the bay; morning yoga classes; and healthy organic dining. From budget beginnings a few decades ago, most of the camps have now matured into more midrange options, with some offering pools and even spa facilities for a very high-class ""camping"" experience. A few, though, still cater to passing hikers and others looking for cheaper digs and offer budget rates for those pitching their own tent.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kabak/
289, Ölüdeniz,Turkey,"Meaning ""Dead Sea"" in Turkish, Ölüdeniz found fame early on in Turkey's tourism boom due to the astonishing beauty of its setting. The long curve of Ölüdeniz Beach's soft golden sand is backed by thick pine tree forests that rise up the slopes of the mountains behind. The beach's western end runs along a thin promontory that reaches into the sea, sheltering the bay beyond which is why the water here is so calm and has a slightly higher salt content than elsewhere (hence the beach's name). This smaller western section is known as the ""Lagoon"" and is officially within a national park, so there's an entrance fee. The main strip of sand is a public beach. Directly behind the main beach, the small settlement of Ölüdeniz is a package-holiday destination, particularly for British tourists. The vibe can be rather rollicking in high season. If that's not your scene, Ölüdeniz is easily visited from Fethiye with regular public transport throughout the day. Ölüdeniz's other claim to fame is that it's Turkey's main paragliding center. Come here to tandem paraglide with spectacular views over the rugged green-clad mountains and Mediterranean beyond, and then swoop down to land on the beach.

290, Cleopatra Beach,Turkey,"In the Mediterranean resort town of Alanya, the main sandy stretch is Cleopatra Beach, which is overlooked by the rugged, orange-hued high cliffs of Alanya's promontory. During summer, this long prime sweep of soft golden sand, which rims the western side of town, is a popular choice for both locals and northern European visitors seeking a good-value beach vacation with plenty of resort options just a hop and skip from the sand. The beach is well-organized, with plenty of sun loungers and shades to rent, as well as cabanas for families or groups who want a more shaded place to lounge. There's also a large variety of restaurants lining the beachfront promenade that provide waiter service direct to sunbathers on the beach. The Alanya Teleferik (cable car) up to the summit of the promontory where Alanya's castle and old town sit, begins just behind Cleopatra Beach, so it's very handy if you need a break from lounging and want to head out to explore the town's major tourist attractions.

291, Pamucak Beach,Turkey,"Backed by young palm trees, scrubland, and olive groves that give way to rolling hills, Pamucak Beach is a wide strip of golden sand that remains mostly undeveloped. During summer, a restaurant opens here for food, refreshments, and sun lounger rental, but for most of the beach's fans, Pamucak's appeal lies in its old-fashioned beach style, with beachgoers bringing along their own picnic, and throwing down a towel on the sand to sunbathe. With few facilities, it won't suit everyone, but if you're looking for a less crowded beach experience and happy to do-it-yourself with supplies, Pamucak provides all the simple pleasures of sun, sand, and surf. The sea here is also shallow enough at the water's edge to be safe for little ones to splash about. Pamucak is nine kilometers west from Selçuk (eight from the ruins of Ephesus) and 14 kilometers north from Kuşadası, and is a stop off along the minibus routes between the two towns, so it's easily visited in combination with a visit to Ephesus.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pamucak+Beach/
292, Parque Nacional Natural Tayrona,Colombia,"Parque Nacional Natural Tayrona has a lush and green look and feel about it owing to its place in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range. The park boasts some truly amazing stretches of golden sand with crystal clear water, backed by swaying palm trees and mountains. The three main beaches in the park, Cabo San Juan de Guia, Playa Cristal, and La Aranilla, each have their characteristics. La Aranilla is the one most photographed, owing to its uniquely shaped granite rocks both in the water and at one end of the beach. The beaches here are primarily day trip destinations, as accommodation is limited in the national park. Santa Marta, with an abundance of accommodation and restaurants, is about 30 minutes away by car and is where most people stay.

Easily reached via a 45-minute scenic boat ride departing right from the port in the Old City, a trip to the beach is one of the popular things to do in Cartagena and a regular excursion arranged by hotels. Set on Isla de Baru, this long and narrow white-sand beach has beautiful clear water and small waves. Set back from the beach are rustic restaurants serving fresh fish and other typical Colombian fare. The water is shallow and warm here and is ideal for floating or snorkeling.

294, Playas de Palomino,Colombia,"A bit farther east of Parque Nacional Natural Tayrona is the quaint small town of Palomino. On the oceanfront here is the spectacular Playas de Palomino. The beach, with its blond sands backed by palm trees, stretches for miles and miles both east and west of town. The beach is, for the most part, deserted, and you will likely have the place all to yourself. The waves here can be large at times, so take care when swimming and always be on the watch for rip currents.

295, Beaches of Isla de Providencia (Providencia Island),Colombia,"When you look at a map, you might be tempted to think that the beaches of Providencia are in Nicaragua but they are in fact Colombian territory. There's a good reason the Colombian's held on to these coral island outposts: stunning beaches and clear waters. Snorkeling and diving here is some of the best in Colombia. Gentle waves lap up against soft white-sand beaches. Time seems to slow down here, as there really isn't much to do except laze about on the beach, snorkel, perhaps chat with the friendly islanders, and think about your next meal.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Beaches+of+Isla+de+Providencia+(Providencia+Island)/
296, La Boquilla,Colombia,"Located at the north end of Cartagena, about five minutes by taxi from the Old City, is La Boquilla. Here, you'll find beach action with a more local feel. The beach here is long, wide, and flat, and it's popular with Colombians visiting from other parts of the country. One of the main reasons for visiting this beach is kitesurfing. Depending on the time of year, the winds pick up here around 2pm, and all the kitesurfers emerge. Even if you aren't a kiter, its's fun to watch them zip across the waves with their colorful kites floating in the sky. Colombia is a great place to learn this popular sport, and prices for lessons are very reasonable. The beach is backed by hotels and some modern residential towers but is rarely crowded. An assortment of restaurants is set back from the beach and offers al fresco dining, with tasty lunches and dinners on the menu. The beach is generally safest near the western edge, which is the more built-up section. Farther west, away from the towers near the small town, you can run into problems with theft, particularly if you leave your personal items unattended while you swim.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Boquilla/

298, The Beaches of Capurgana & the Walk to La Miel in Panama,Colombia,"These beaches are near the border with Panama in the Choco region. They take a bit of effort to get to, however those who make the trek are rewarded by wonderful warm waters, sugar-soft sands, and the green jungle in behind. The main beach in front of Capurgana is called Playa Soledad and is a small crescent beach, well protected from the offshore surf. Be sure to put on a mask and do some snorkeling, the underwater life here is abundant. For a real adventure that involves crossing the border with Panama, you can head to La Miel.

299, Manzanillo del Mar,Colombia,"Now easier to access than ever with the new bridge over Ciena De Tesca lagoon, Manzanillo del Mar is only 15 minutes from the Old Town of Cartagena. The beach, with its salt and pepper sands, is exceptionally long, and beach walkers will run out of energy before they reach the end. Views here are quite beautiful, with the large headland at the south end and the towers of Cartagena glimmering in the distance. This is a good beach to escape the crowds and beach vendors of Bocagrande and La Boquilla. This is also a popular kite surfing destination. Depending on the season, the winds tend to pick up around 2pm each day. Manzanillo Del Mar is a perfect beach for a big family get together owing to the fact that you can drive your vehicle right out onto the sand and easily set up your barbecue, lawn chairs, and tables right around your car. Should you wish to play music, just open the doors and back hatch and serenade the beach. This is truly one of the last stretches of wide-open, undeveloped beach near Cartagena. While there is less out here than you'll find at La Boquilla, it's a safer area, with less crime and a more family-focused feel. The waves here can get large and can be fun to play in. Note that there isn't a whole lot out here, so bring your supplies with you. Accommodation: Best Hotels in Cartagena", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Manzanillo+del+Mar/
300, Guachalito,Colombia,"For those with a real taste for adventure looking to truly get away from it all, the beach at Guachalito is like something out of the movie Jurassic Park. Situated on the Pacific Ocean, this is one of the areas in Colombia where the jungle meets the ocean, and the resulting ecosystem is unlike any other in the country. The sand is soft and brown, and large surf breaks offshore, gently rolling in across wide, flat beaches. Otherworldly plants and animals inhabit this area, and you'll find interesting flora and fauna, including huge mushrooms, colorful hummingbirds zipping about, and butterflies flitting from plant to plant. To cap it all off, humpback whales can sometimes be seen just offshore. Getting here is via a small plane from Medellin to Nuqui and then a 30-minute boat ride.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Guachalito/
301, Playa de Castillo Grande,Colombia,"Just around the corner from Bocagrande in Cartagena is the stretch of sand called Castillo Grande. This is the best beach on the peninsula and a good alternative to the beaches of Bocagrande. The beach is generally protected from the winds that whip up the sea in the afternoons in the windy season of January to March. The water here is clear, and the beach is wide and long, ideal for a stroll. At one end is the Hilton Cartagena, and at the other is the Naval Club. The busiest section is near the hotel. Beach umbrellas and chairs are available for rent and are a good idea, as there is absolutely no shade here. Beach vendors selling cold drinks and snacks operate here but are less aggressive than those at Bocagrande. Boats leave from this area to travel to the white-sand beaches of Punta Arena on Tiera Bomba Island.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Playa+de+Castillo+Grande/
302, Playa de Bocagrande,Colombia,"Playa de Bocagrande is Cartagena's main strip of beach. Some have compared Bocagrande to the beaches of Miami. This comparison is valid for the towers but not for the beaches. The beaches here are smaller, and you come here mostly for the scene not generally to go swimming. Beaches tend to get crowded, but that doesn't stop the people in the hotels and towers from flocking to the seashore. Just back from the beaches are an assortment of restaurants ranging from fast food to high end. The beaches in Cartagena do not have the azure blue colors you expect from the Caribbean, however, don't let that deter you, the water is warm and generally clean and safe for swimming. Note that Bocagrande has a lot of beach vendors, some that can be quite persistent. Accommodation: Best Hotels in Cartagena", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Playa+de+Bocagrande/
303, Punta Gallinas,Colombia,"Are you up for an adventure? Well the trek to Punta Gallinas, the northernmost point in South America is not easy, but the rewards are more than worth the effort. What you'll find at the end of your journey are giant sand dunes descending right into the Atlantic Ocean. The Tarao Dunes are part of the La Guajira desert, the largest in Colombia. This place is so remote, that you'll have miles and miles of beautiful beach all to yourself. The only other things around are the local wildlife and the ever-present wind. Take a dip in the ocean, and let the cool waters soothe you; rest assured it won't take long to warm up once you lie out on the sun-baked sand. Punta Gallinas is on the bucket list of many kiteboarders. The strong winds and flat waters of the inland bays complete with pink flamingos make for ideal conditions. Take a bit of time away from the beach to check out the handicrafts produced by the local Wayuu Tribe. The most popular items include the intricately woven and colorful Mochila bags in various sizes. The best way to get out here is with a tour that will include your meals, transport in a Land Cruiser 4x4, and very basic accommodation.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Punta+Gallinas/
304, Inchydoney Beach,Ireland,"This southern Ireland beach is one of the island's best attributes. Free from stones and litter, the soft, white sand is perfect for a long, barefoot walk. Time your stroll for low tide, when you can venture even farther from shore into the crystal-clear water. It's deemed one of Ireland's Blue Flag beaches, which means it's been certified by the Foundation for Environmental Education for promoting environmental awareness and sustainable development. This also means it's an area of natural beauty, where both the water and beach are clean and safe. A surfer at heart? The waves at this fantastic beach in Cork make it ideal for beginners and more experienced surfers. During high season, there are plenty of lifeguards to ensure your safety, which means this is a good beach for families in Ireland. Insider's tip: Take a time-out from beachin' at the nearby Inchydoney Island Lodge & Spa. Grab a cuppa or enjoy a delicious lunch at this four-star beach resort. Inchydoney beach is a short distance (about 6.4 kilometers) from Clonakilty, a picturesque town (and past winner of the Tidy Towns Competition) bursting with restaurants, shops, and plenty of music.

305, Inch Beach,Ireland,"Located on the Dingle Peninsula in southwest Ireland, Inch beach is a must-visit on your tour of the best beaches in Ireland. Crashing waves caress the golden sand of this finger-shaped peninsula as they bring avid surfers back to shore. Swimming here is a treat (albeit a cold one). Where else can you kick your way toward lush rolling hills? The current is strong, as are the tides, so keep hold of little ones. It's also super windy, so you might want to leave that beach umbrella in the car. It, too, is a Blue Flag beach. About 50 minutes from the best tourist attractions in Killarney, Inch Beach is often considered a Killarney beach. Made famous by David Lean's film, Ryan's Daughter, its name wrongly implies a small piece of beach. This more than four-kilometer-wide expanse juts into the sea between Dingle and Castlemaine harbors, offering up views of the Slieve Mish and MacGillicuddy Reeks. Be sure to visit during low tide for an unbeatable view. If you're lucky, you'll be able to see the sky mirrored on the newly uncovered sand below. Insider's tip: While you can park your car on the sand, be sure to keep track of the tide - you don't want your ride to float away later.", County Kerry,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Inch+Beach/
306, Banna Strand,Ireland,"Another Blue Flag beach, Banna Strand is backed by sand dunes rising to 40 feet. It's a great area for surfing and windsurfing, and the shallow waters make it a popular vacation spot for families. Surrounded by rolling hills, you'll be able to walk for miles when the tide is out. A paved path running behind the beach is ideal for bikes or strollers. This is a perfect spot to take a break while touring the Wild Atlantic Way (more than 2,500 kilometers of spectacular coastline on the island's west side, winding from the Inishowen Peninsula in the north to Kinsale in the south). You won't find loads of shops or amenities, so be sure to pack a picnic. Tralee is only 11 kilometers away. The largest town in the county, it boasts comfortable hotels and a bevy of shops and restaurants. Don't miss the photo-worthy Blennerville Windmill.

307, Dog's Bay,Ireland,"Shaped like a horseshoe, this Galway beach is a must-see for beach lovers. Dog's Bay sits back to back with Guerteen Bay, a similarly beautiful beach just off the road to Clifden. Both are within a few minutes' drive, or an easy walk, from Roundstone village. Being well sheltered makes Dog's Bay one of the island's best spots for safe swimming and water sports, like kitesurfing or windsurfing. Another bonus: the water along this clean 1.6-kilometer stretch of beach is exceptionally clear. Look closely at the sand. Instead of being formed by rocks, as you'll find on other beaches on this list of the best beaches in Ireland, the sand at Dog's Bay consists of tiny shells from foraminifera (a type of sea creature), making it serenely soft and white. In the summer, you'll find wildflowers sprouting amid the grass. Also known as machair vegetation, this greenery is considered rare and can only be found on Ireland's west coast. Insider's tip: You won't find concessions nearby, so come prepared, or plan a visit to O'Dowd's of Roundstone restaurant.", County Galway,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dog's+Bay/
308, Strandhill,Ireland,"A popular beach destination for locals and tourists alike, Strandhill is a wonderful place to take lessons in everything from bodyboarding to surfing. It's located only about eight kilometers from Sligo, the second largest city in western Ireland. Want to get farther out on the water? Rent a kayak and tour famous landmarks and unbeatable scenery. Sick of the sand? Try your hand at a round of golf at the Strandhill Golf Club. Or, settle down in a relaxing seaweed bath, an Irish tradition spanning hundreds of years. In the early 20th century, there were nine seaweed bath houses in Strandhill, the last of which was destroyed by hurricane Debbie in 1961. VOYA has reinstituted a bath just for this purpose. Every Sunday (from 11am to 4pm), you'll find the Strandhill People's Market in Hangar 1 of the Sligo Airport. Looking for handmade jewelry?

309, Silver Strand Beach,Ireland,"Who would have thought they'd find paradise on a Donegal beach? This crescent-shaped marvel opens to crystal-clear turquoise water that begs you to jump in. On both sides are dramatic cliffs and graceful waterfalls that help reset your inner stress button. Safe and shallow, Silver Strand is a big hit with families. An added bonus for those with little ones: lifeguards supervise the area during the summer months. Located in the tiny village of Malin Beg, Silver Strand can be pretty empty in the off-season. So, if you're hoping for an idyllic, romantic beach vacation, try visiting in April or May. It may be chilly, but you're more likely to have this pristine oasis to yourselves. Insider's tip: Low tide is the time to visit Silver Strand. You'll have much more beach to walk, run, or lounge on, as high tide covers most of the impeccable sand.", County Donegal,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Silver+Strand+Beach/
310, Rossbeigh,Ireland,"Touring Ireland without visiting the Ring of Kerry is like leaving Wimbledon before the tennis matches begin. Its giant hills, flourishing countryside, and verdant mountains leave travelers in awe of the natural beauty this lush country has to offer. Rossbeigh beach is another unmissable spot located on the Ring of Kerry, a mere two miles from a small village named Glenbeigh. Located on the Iveragh Peninsula (just opposite the Dingle Peninsula, which houses Inch Beach), Rossbeigh is often referred to as a Killarney beach. The reason: Killarney is only 35 kilometers away, which makes it a fantastic place to stay the night (or two or three). Another Blue Flag beach, Rossbeigh boasts a children's playground, pristine sand, and impeccable mountain and sea views. The surf isn't overpowering, and lifeguards are on duty throughout the summer, making this a good beach for families. Insider tip: Time your visit for the end of August, when you can glimpse the annual Glenbeigh Horse and Pony Races, which take place on Rossbeigh Strand.", County Kerry,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rossbeigh/
311, Coumeenoole,Ireland,"The Dingle peninsula is filled with fabulous beaches (we're looking at you, Inch Beach). Coumeenoole, on Slea Head Drive near Dingle, is one of them. On a sunny day, the turquoise water appears tropical as it crashes into the golden shore. Low tide is the best time to visit, as you'll have more sand to explore and an ability to get up close and personal with the imposing jagged cliffs. Kitesurfers and windsurfers favor this spot, so while you won't have to fight massive crowds at this more secluded beach, you won't be alone. That said, being secluded with only the cliffs above offers a very safe and serene beach-going experience. Being sheltered also makes this beach a safe spot to visit with kids. Many travelers say they can stay here for hours. Nearby, you'll find the Fahan Beehive Huts (at the south side of Mount Eagle and west of Dingle). These five huts were likely single-family dwellings, made of corbeled stone, that remain attached to each other.", County Kerry,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Coumeenoole/
312, Portmarnock Beach,Ireland,"Searching for the best beaches near Dublin? Look no further than the Velvet Strand, a name given to multiple beaches within a stone's throw of the giant city.

Your reward: a lovely view of Howth Head and Ireland's Eye.  Behind Portmarnock Beach lies a long, paved path (a.k.a. coastal walkway) and miles of impressive sand dunes set for little (or big) kids and dogs to climb. Yes, you read that correctly, dogs are allowed on this beach, and you'll be hard-pressed to find a time when you won't find a four-legged friend enjoying a nice walk by the ocean.  Avid explorers can enjoy a walk to the Martello Tower, situated at the start of the walkway leading to Malahide. When you're tuckered out from all that walking, treat yourself to a comfortable stay at Portmarnock's White Sands Hotel, or at least a meal in their Oasis restaurant overlooking the sea. Insider's tip: Park in the much less crowded South Beach car park and walk along the path through the dunes.", County Dublin,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Portmarnock+Beach/
313, Derrynane,Ireland,"Sheltered beaches seem to be a thing in Ireland-luckily for us! Derrynane Beach, another must-visit on your tour of the Ring of Kerry, is surrounded by large hills and grassy cliffs. The water is a dreamy azure, while the clean, white sand is ideal for sandcastle building. The beach is peppered with large rocks; it's nature's way of enticing kids to play. Another plus for families: the ocean is relatively calm, making swimming more accessible to kids. This is easily one of the best beaches for families in Ireland. About three kilometers to the northwest, you'll find the quaint village of Caherdaniel. It boasts O'Carroll's Cove, a long-standing restaurant that offers fresh, tasty seafood with amazing views of the beach.

Located on Achill Island, the largest of the Irish Isles, Keem Bay lies off Ireland's northwest coast. To get here, you'll have to cross the Michael Davitt Bridge, which runs between the villages of Gob an Choire and Poll Raithní. The scenery is what entices people to visit and what makes it hard for them to leave. With views of the Croaqhaun and Slievemore mountains, Achill is a veritable wonderland that will literally cause your jaw to drop. It's also home to five Blue Flag beaches (Keem, Dugort, Golden Strand, Dooega, and Keel). Keem Bay, one of the island's most beautiful beaches, is unspoiled and rewards visitors with an unparalleled view. It's bordered by dramatic cliffs (of Croaghaun mountain to the east and the Moyteoge spar to the west). Keem Bay is also a hot spot for water sports. Tourists flock here to swim, kayak, surf, and windsurf. Once a haven for shark fishing, the bay is now an incredible (and protected) place to snorkel. Hikers won't want to miss the mile-long trail that begins here and makes its way along the cliffs of Benmore towards Achill Head. The best part of the Keem Bay experience, though, might be the drive to get here. Winding along a clifftop route, with the Croaghuan mountain on one side and the Atlantic Ocean on the other, the scenery is spectacular.

Gracing the west shore of Lough Swilly, on the Fanad Peninsula, this wide tan beach has won awards for its beauty. Surrounded by lush, green hills and fronted by stunning azure waves, the scenery is magnificent. The soft sand is another plus, making it easy to spend a day beachin' at the shore. Also known as Portsalon Beach (due to its position near the small village of Portsalon), it's easy to see why this is one of the best beaches in Ireland. At this Blue Flag beach, you can expect pristine conditions and lifeguards on duty during the summer months. If you're hoping for the best view, you'll find it atop the Knockalla Hills.

316, Streedagh Strand,Ireland,"Over three kilometers of silky, soft golden sand greet visitors to Streedagh Strand in County Sligo. A horseshoe-shaped beauty, this is one of the best beaches for couples and families in Ireland. It is backed by sand dunes, which offer impeccable views, and is set in a sheltered locale, which makes this an ideal spot for swimming. While some still find enough waves for a surf, the calm bay is an enticing place to let little ones splash about safely. In 1588, three ships from the Spanish Armada sank on this beach while attempting to shield themselves from a storm. Today, parts of their remains can be seen at low tide.

Located at the head of Liscannor Bay, the town's beach occupies about one mile of golden sand. The reason most people flock here, though, has more to do with the epic waves. The bay's horseshoe shape creates a break in the Atlantic that results in the most ideal waves for surfing enthusiasts. While surfing has become the number one sport at this beach, surfers aren't the only ones who love this popular vacation spot-canoers, sailors, swimmers, and divers are only too happy to jump in. There's plenty to do when you're bored of lazing on the sand. Love to fish? Rent a boat and take your rod and tackle to the great wide open. Want to golf? Book a tee time at one of the town's two championship golf courses (Lahinch Golf Course and Lahinch Castle Golf Course). Insider tip: Stick around for sunset and keep your camera at the ready. You'll be happy you did. Also, wear beach shoes-there are lots of rocks around.", County Clare,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lahinch+Beach/
318, Trà an Doilin Beach,Ireland,"Translated from Irish to ""Coral Strand,"" Trà an Doilin beach is best known for being a coral beach. Its fine, white sand is made of coral (coraline algae, to be precise), and it's one of only two beaches on Ireland's west coast to boast this unique feature. Those with inquisitive minds and a love of nature could while away hours scouring the small rock pools. Others may prefer to get right in on the action by scuba diving in the uber clear water just off the coast. Being a Blue Flag beach, Trà an Doilin is extremely clean and safe, with lifeguards on duty during high season. The closest village is Carraroe, which is located in the Irish speaking section of Connemara. It's most famous for its fishing boats, known as Galway Hookers.", County Galway,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Trà+an+Doilin+Beach/
319, Fanore Beach,Ireland,"Fanore Beach is located by the Burren, an isolated area comprised of impressive limestone that lies along the Wild Atlantic Way. In stark contrast to the vibrant greens we're used to seeing on the Emerald Isle, the Burren makes us appreciate a more stark, yet remarkably beautiful image of Ireland. The Burren is also famed for its numerous ring forts, caves, and castles. Fanore Beach provides tourists with an escape from this dry, grey landscape. Bursting with hues of gold and black, the beach is perfect for long, relaxing walks through the sand. Surfing lessons abound, as the waves are ample enough to provide beginners with a fun, yet not too challenging, ride. This beach is also famed for being one of the ""nine sites of geological importance that form the basis of the Burren and Cliffs of Moher Global Geopark."" No wonder there are so many rocks to climb.", County Clare,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fanore+Beach/
320, Tramore Beach,Ireland,"Perched atop steep hills, the lovely resort town of Tramore slopes dramatically towards its most popular, dune-backed attraction, Tramore Beach. Winner of multiple Blue Flag Beach awards, this pretty, five-kilometer stretch of sand is incredibly popular, especially during the warmer summer months. Be prepared to fight for a spot on the sand if you visit on a particularly lovely day. Swimming, fishing, sailing, kayaking, and surfing are prominent activities, as is kite surfing on windy days. During high season, lifeguards are on hand to keep watch over the beach. Rugged cliffs provide remarkable views of Tramore Bay at this picturesque spot on Ireland's southeast coast.", Tramore County,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tramore+Beach/
321, Sandwood Bay,Scotland,"Sandwood Bay is described by many as the most beautiful beach in the United Kingdom. The spectacular mile-long band of pink sand that enriches this serene beach is considered to be one of the cleanest and most unspoiled beaches in Scotland. Set near Kinlochbervie, Sandwood Bay is backed by impressive sand dunes and a deep freshwater loch. Facing an often capricious North Atlantic Ocean, precipitous weathered cliffs flank this remote location on the far northwest coast of Scotland, the domain of noisy gulls and other assorted seabirds. The outstanding natural feature is Am Buachaille, a 213-foot-high sea stack, which stands at the tip of the Rubh'a Bhuachaille headland at the southern end of this west coast beach. You'll need to make an effort to reach this remote bay. There's no road access and getting to the beach requires a four-mile walk from the car park in the hamlet of Blairmore. The trail is fairly flat and snakes through rough moorland, which at times can be quite boggy. Tough, waterproof footwear is advisable. And why not pack a picnic? Sandwood Bay is a magical place, and the views are splendid. Accommodation: Where to Stay in Kinlochbervie", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sandwood+Bay/
322, Camusdarach Beach,Scotland,"Located a short jaunt south of the Morar estuary is this stunningly attractive beach - a broad half-moon of powdery, white sand accessed by an effortless amble through low dunes. Hemmed in by rocky peninsulas that are carpeted by an array of wildflowers in the summer, Camusdarach Beach is a regional favorite and was popular long before its use as a location in the classic 1983 movie Local Hero, which starred Hollywood legend Burt Lancaster. Lapped by luminous green waters that remain somewhat chilly even during the high season, this is a place to soak up the sun rather than bathe. Kids will love rock pooling, and the beach is perfect picnic territory. Situated on the so-called ""Road to the Isles,"" Camusdarach and its coastline afford wonderful postcard views of the outlying Isles of Rum and Eigg, their misty blue peaks adding dramatic perspective to the near horizon. The Isle of Skye's Cuillin Hills further enhance the scene to place this particular pocket of Scotland among the most scenic in the country. Hikers can follow the coastal paths that snake away either side of the sandy arc, or can venture inland above Loch Morar for a sensational change of scenery. Camusdarach Beach is also one of the best beaches to get married in Scotland. It doesn't get more romantic than that!

323, Seacliff Beach,Scotland,"Historic Seacliff comprises a beach, a residential estate, and a harbor. You reach Seacliff via a private road, and a nominal fee is charged in order to access the beach. Don't worry, it's worth every penny! This little-known corner of Scotland is steeped in history. Located on the estate is Tantallon Castle, a semi-ruined mid-14th-century fortress and the last medieval curtain wall castle to be constructed in the country. The tiny harbor is remarkable. Dating back to 1890, it was carved out of red limestone using steam-driven compressed air. The broad sweep of Seacliff Beach attracts surfers, canoeists, dog-walkers, horse-riders, and summer picnickers, but only at low tide: much of the beach is otherwise submerged. Textured with scattered rock, the beach takes on a distinctly rusty hue after the sea has receded due to the prevalence of red limestone in the area. Seacliff makes for a rewarding amble. Besides the aforementioned Tantallon Castle, look out for the remains of Auldhame Castle, another reminder of Seacliff's strategic military significance throughout history. You'll also catch a glimpse of Seacliff House. Originally built in 1750, this once-grand mansion now stands as a forlorn ruin, unoccupied since 1907. Did anyone mention ghosts?

324, St,Scotland,"Here's a real treat! Pocket-sized St. Ninian's Isle is connected to mainland Shetland by a spectacular sand tombolo - the largest in the UK. Effectively an enormous sand bank, the tombolo, known locally as an ayre, is above sea level during the summer months and reveals itself as one of the nicest beaches in the area. Accessible by foot, this unusual band of sand is a quarter mile long and while not a very practical destination for swimmers, serves as a perfect bridge for beachgoers wishing to explore St. Ninian's Isle. The island has an area of about 72 hectares and is crowned by the evocative ruins of a 12th-century chapel. St. Ninian's hit the headlines in 1958, when a hoard of stunning medieval artifacts was discovered under the floorboards of the adjoining church: the destination is celebrated for its ecclesiastical wonders! There's little in the way of leisure facilities at this top Scottish beach. St. Ninian's appeal lies in its relative seclusion and historical clout. But if you're the outdoorsy type, there's plenty of distraction. Ornithologists will be amazed by the wealth of seabirds the island attracts, especially puffins. Hikers can romp through a beautifully stark landscape that embraces some fine cliff-top scenery (trails start at the car park). And on bright clear days, the beach is a veritable sun-trap. Note, however, that in winter the beach is often engulfed by choppy waves, making St. Ninian's a somewhat seasonal destination.

325, Luskentyre Beach,Scotland,"On clear, sunny days, the shallow aquamarine and turquoise waters lapping Luskentyre Beach appear so luminous, you'd be forgiven for thinking you were standing on a beach in Greece. Luskentyre is one of Scotland's great outdoor pleasures and one of the best beaches in the country. This ideal location is set well off the tourist trail but it's a dream to discover and explore. This is not a place to enjoy a leisurely swim. Chilly Atlantic Ocean temperatures make Luskentyre a paddling destination at best. But the wide expanse of powder-fine sand, a stunning mountain backdrop, and an exhilarating sense of the remote offer up some truly memorable hiking options. Besides splendid walking opportunities afforded by the beach itself (undertaken barefooted, of course), the circular 2.5-mile trail snaking through the dunes should also be trodden. Keen cyclists can follow a single-track road that links the beach to Harris's main highway. Luskentyre Beach is bereft of leisure amenities. For shops, restaurants, and cultural diversions head for towns like Northon. And remember, the Isle of Harris is world-famous for its Harris Tweed. Hand-woven by islanders, the woolen garments make unique souvenirs. Accommodation: Where to Stay on the Isle of Harris", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Luskentyre+Beach/
326, Loch Morlich,Scotland,"Scotland's only freshwater beach carpets the shores of Loch Morlich, a beautiful lake set in the heart of the Cairngorms mountain range. Surrounded by forest, Loch Morlich is one of the country's premier water sports destinations. The sandy bay provides an ideal site for indulging in an array of outdoor activities both on and off the water. During the high season, the lake benefits from the first-class Loch Morlich Watersports facility. Activities offered include sailing, windsurfing, stand up paddleboarding, kayaking, and canoeing. Mountain bikers can follow a challenging course through the Glenmore Forest, where a network of trails can also be hiked. Equipment hire is available, and the center offers lessons for beginners and novices. Of course, for those who'd rather do nothing, the beach — a recipient of a Seaside Award by the Keep Scotland Beautiful campaign — is a marvelous excuse to do just that: nothing! In fact, it's quite novel to lie back and catch a few rays in the middle of the Scottish Highlands, and when you do fancy a dip, the water is as clear and sparkling as a summer's day. The closest town to this beach is Aviemore, which is located about 15 minutes away by car. Accommodation: Where to Stay in Aviemore", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Loch+Morlich/
327, Sango Bay,Scotland,"Remote Sango Bay features one of the most northerly beaches in mainland Scotland. In fact, the nearby village of Durness marks the most northwesterly point of the country. The beach, an alluring slice of sandy seclusion, is divided into three smaller coves by a series of rocky outcrops. Rocks, stacks, and skerries pepper the sand; the surrounding coastline is some of Europe's most spectacular and isolated. A campsite perched above Sango Bay with access to the beach caters for tourists, as does a youth hostel. There are also modest hotel accommodation options and a couple of good restaurants. The area's main attractions are the natural wonders found in and around Durness. Make sure you explore Smoo Cave, a spectacular combined sea cave and freshwater cave and the largest of its kind in Britain. A leisurely amble out to any of the nearby headlands will reveal jaw-dropping panoramic views of the North Minch - the channel between the mainland and the Hebrides. Seals and porpoises patrol these waters, and minke whales have also been spotted. Balnakeil craft village, located just outside Durness, makes for an interesting cultural diversion, and if you're a Beatles fan, look out for a small garden in Durness dedicated to John Lennon, who holidayed here as a teenager and then revisited the area in 1969 with Yoko Ono and their children.

328, Oldshoremore Beach,Scotland,"Oldshoremore Bay comprises two pristine sandy beaches, Oldshoremore itself and its sister beach Phollain. A craggy isle known as Eilean na h-Aiteig, which means ""isle of the shy girl,"" separates both. In summer, the ocean is often warm and inviting, as the sheltered bays are south-facing and peaceful. The location is equally rewarding for hikers. A way-signed walk follows a coastal path, which leads away from the steps down to the sand. In spring, over 200 varieties of flowering plants fleck the grass above the beach, the carpet of color providing dazzling contrast against the lead-blue sea. In fact, the entire region falls within the boundaries of a protected nature reserve. Oldshoremore itself is a scattered crofting hamlet of around 20 houses. Visitors arriving by vehicle can use the car park, where there are toilet facilities. Unfortunately, the hamlet is served infrequently by public transport. The nearby town of Kinlochbervie is your best bet for a warm meal and a comfy place to stay. Accommodation: Where to Stay in Kinlochbervie", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Oldshoremore+Beach/
329, Gullane Beach,Scotland,"Nestling on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth in East Lothian is the town of Gullane, best known for its golf courses but also celebrated for its magnificent sandy beach. Known as Gullane Bents, this glorious swathe of golden sand draws windsurfing and kitesurfing enthusiasts when the weather is windy. One of the best beaches in Scotland, this is an equally alluring destination for picnics and family days out on warm, sunny days. Backed by impressive dunes textured with sea-buckthorn and other shrubs, Gullane Beach fringes the John Muir Way, a long-distance footpath that snakes along the coast between Musselburgh and Dunglass. The route takes in Gullane Point, a local beauty spot that affords sweeping views across the bay and out onto the Firth of Forth. Gullane Bents offers limited leisure amenities, so anyone seeking leisurely diversions will need to head into Gulland, where there are plenty of things to do and places to see. The three golf courses in the vicinity include the famous Muirfield Golf Club. If you want to practice your swing, you'll have to book well in advance.

One of the best beaches near Edinburgh, it's less than 10 minutes by train from Edinburgh's Waverly Station, or 20 minutes by bus to reach the charming town of Portobello and its pretty west coast beach. Sailing, kite flying, sandcastle building, swimming, and beach walking are popular activities on and near the two-mile strip of sand. The paved promenade lining the beach is a lovely place to enjoy a run, push a pram, or simply stop to enjoy the view. Close by lie the shops and restaurants that make Portobello so inviting. Stopping here for lunch is a nice way to break up the day.

With captivating views of the Firth of Clyde and a mix of sand, grass, and pebble for its base, this pretty sliver of land is one of the best beaches near Glasgow. From the beach, visitors are treated to an excellent view of the most famous monument in Largs, and the inspiration behind this beach's unique name: The Pencil. It was built in 1912 to honor the 1263 Battle of Largs. At only 300 meters, Pencil Beach is small enough to be incredibly family-friendly. It also boasts calm, shallow (though chilly) water, which is ideal for little ones who'd like to swim. This is a west coast beach worth visiting. To get here from Glasgow, simply board a train to Largs from Glasgow Central. It will take about an hour and a half. Driving, on the other hand, will get you here in just over 40 minutes.

These illustrious isles are also home to some pretty spectacular Scottish beaches. Sanday is one of the largest inhabited isles of the Orkney archipelago. It lies on the outer islands, and its top beaches are divine—think soft, Caribbean white sand and sparkling azure waves. One of the best beaches in Sanday is Whitemill Bay Beach. This beauty is backed by sand dunes and the iridescent Whitemill Bay, which is so bright and clean, you’ll think you’re in the tropics. Technically the pristine, scallop-shaped shore of Sanday is one giant beach, as it wraps its way around the island, but this section of Whitemill Bay Beach is by far one of the best.

333, Tolsta Beach,Scotland,"The Isle of Lewis lies at the Northwest corner of the Outer Hebrides island and is home to a small village named Tolsta. The town's beach, conveniently called Tolsta Beach, spans the coast just northeast of Stornoway. You can find its pretty shore at the north end of the B895. This secluded spot, with surfable waves, facilities, and plenty of sand to play in, is a wonderful beach for families in Scotland. Pack a picnic to prolong your stay, as there aren’t any snack bars or restaurants on-site. When you’re bored of playing in the surf, head for a walk across a deep gorge on the concrete Bridge to Nowhere (a.k.a. Garry Bridge). Once you’ve crossed the bridge, the path leads pretty much nowhere, hence the name, but you can still manage to walk for miles.

334, Aberdeen Beach,Scotland,"Known as “The Flower of Scotland,” Aberdeen rewards visitors with gorgeous parks and gardens. Its soft, sandy shore presents guests with some of the best beaches in Scotland. If you’re looking for a fun, clean, and convenient beach, Aberdeen Beach is the perfect place for your Scottish beach vacation. Winner of the Scotland Beach Awards in 2021 and the Resort Seaside Award in 2013, this popular city beach is lined with all the necessities for an action-packed day at the shore. Cafés, restaurants, an amusement park, water sports, and shops are within walking distance of the sand. A unique esplanade (Art Deco in style) runs behind the shore, transporting visitors and offering them fab sea views. Keep your eyes peeled while admiring the vistas — bottle-nosed dolphins play here throughout the summer. If you’re lucky, you’ll spot a few during your visit. The beach stretches for two miles, from the mouth of the River Don to the harbor. It’s also home to large groins (barrier walls used to prevent erosion) that run across the sand.

336, Naama Bay,Egypt,"One of Egypt's most famous sandy strips, Naama Bay's scoop of white-sand beach sits at the epicenter of Egypt's prime beach resort, Sharm el-Sheikh, on the Sinai Peninsula. Sun seekers from across Northern and Eastern Europe decamp here during the winter months to loll on sand lapped by the calm, aqua-blue waters of the Gulf of Aqaba and gaze out at the dusky jagged silhouette of Saudi Arabia's mountainous coastline in the distance. Before the beachgoers beelined here in vast numbers, Sharm el-Sheikh was already known for its scuba diving, with a multitude of coral reefs, including the world-class dive sites of Ras Mohammed National Park, within easy reach. Today, this makes it Egypt's top choice for a beach break with added underwater action. Both complete beginners and more experienced divers will find plenty of dive trips that cater to their level. You can snorkel just off Naama Bay itself, though more colorful reefs need to be accessed by boat. Behind the beach is Sharm el-Sheikh's lively, main resort area, with plenty of restaurants and cafés, as well as accommodation ranging from large resorts like the Movenpick Sharm El Sheikh, which sits on the northern clifftop overlooking the bay, to cozy midrange hotels such as Oonas Dive Club, with its friendly, family-run feel. The Naama Bay shoreline is split into separate private sections, owned by the resorts that line the shore.

For an actual beach, head just to the south of the center to the sheltered bay known as Dahab Lagoon. This curved strip of golden sand edges the bay, backed by the craggy red-hued Sinai Mountain Range. While Dahab remains best known for its scuba diving opportunities (it is Egypt's top destination for learning to dive) and its backpacker-friendly choice of accommodation, the Lagoon area concentrates more on travelers who simply want to sloth out on the sand. It's home to Dahab's most luxurious places to stay, including the contemporary-styled Le Meridien Dahab Resort. If you do want to mix up your holiday with some more active pursuits though, don't worry. The Lagoon hotels all offer dive trips, and the Lagoon's beach is also a major kitesurfing destination, with water sports operators offering both equipment hire and week-long lesson packages. Off the beach, Dahab is a great destination for those looking for a more casual and local vacation scene.

El Gouna is dedicated to resort-style holidays that offer plenty of diversions off the beach for those who want to do more than soak up the sun, with stand up paddleboarding, kayaking, horse riding, and desert ATV tours all available, along with an 18-hole golf course. There are four main beach areas, including the wide swath of Mangroovy Beach, which is El Gouna's kitesurfing central, and the soft white sand of Zeytouna Beach, with its 400-meter-long jetty allowing you to stroll out to the deeper water where the coral reefs lie to conserve your energy for snorkeling. Most of the hotels here are large, low-slung resorts surrounded by mature gardens of palm trees that lead out to the beach, such as the Sheraton Miramar Resort, though there's a couple of smaller midrange options that focus on attracting visitors who've come here purely to kitesurf. Head here if you want to easily add a day trip to Luxor's famous Valley of the Kings and Temple of Karnak into your beach break or want to do some diving in the many reefs offshore from Hurghada.

Sure, you'd need to head out on a dive trip to access the spectacular lower depths of the Ras Um Sid reef, but even snorkelers are able to see a myriad of soft corals and spot rainbow-hued, flitting reef fish close to the surface. It's no wonder then that this golden-sand beach, backed by a cliff, is a highly popular outing for visitors staying in the more central Naama Bay area. While here, don't miss hanging out for a while in the cliff-top Farsha Café, where the rambling terraces enjoy panoramic views.

This is beach life that harks back to the days before the Sinai Peninsula's tourism boom. Facilities are few, and for those that head here, that's just the way they like it. Most camps consist of a main restaurant area, strewn with low cushioned sitting areas, where guests can order food and drink, and simple huts, made from date palm-fronds, that sit directly on the sand only steps from the lapping waves. Bathroom facilities are usually shared, and electricity in many is only available for a set number of hours daily.

While Hurghada, to the north, and Sharm el-Sheikh, on the Sinai Peninsula, became booming diving hot spots, regularly featuring on top ten lists for diving worldwide, Marsa Alam remained an obscure destination little known outside the diving community. The secret, though, is now firmly out, and the resorts have moved in to develop this long strip of coastline. For experienced divers, Marsa Alam is the best base to access the astonishing kaleidoscope-colored reefs of the Red Sea's far south, but the hotels now hugging the shore have snapped up the strips of white sand, meaning a vacation in Marsa Alam can now combine sun-lounging in resort comfort as well as diving.

Taba itself, though, is worth a stop for its beach life. Lesser known than Sharm el-Sheikh, 215 kilometers to the south, the central Taba area has just one resort hotel plus the self-contained Taba Heights complex just to the south of Taba town. At Taba Heights, a handful of family-friendly all-inclusive resorts front swaths of white-sand beach looking out onto the calm waters of the Gulf of Aqaba.

The family theme continues onto the beach, where beach volleyball and beach football are offered, along with snorkeling and dive trips to see the Red Sea's famed reefs, while many staying here also choose to add some off-the-sand sightseeing into their beach time and head inland to Luxor's Pharaonic temples and tombs on day trips.

The best piece of sand is Mamoura Beach on the eastern side of town, which has both a public strip of beach and a private beach.

The pick of the bunch is Cleopatra Beach, sitting at the tip of Marsa Matruh's thin peninsula. The beach is famous for a local myth that Cleopatra and Mark Antony once bathed here in a sheltered natural pool between the rocks, known as Cleopatra's Bath. Today you, too, can soak up the regal connotations and take a dip in the pool. Accommodation: Where to Stay in Marsa Matruh", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cleopatra+Beach/

350, Zlatni Rat,Croatia,"Want to go to the fairest, most famous Croatia beach of all? Low and behold Zlatni Rat.

352, Punta Rata,Croatia,"Punta Rata is a bigger beach in the area, known for soft sand and clear water. You can expect plenty of tourists, locals, and families. Take your pick of bicycling the unpaved trails or running the coast by foot. Because of the location, you'll have views of the Biokovo mountain range from Punta Rata, and if you walk long enough, you'll come across the Brela Stone. This is what everyone takes a photo in front of, so get your phone ready to pose with a giant boulder that somehow grows pine trees. When you arrive in Croatia, you'll likely fly into Split, an hour drive northwest of Punta Rata.", Brela,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Punta+Rata/

355, Nugal Beach,Croatia,"Pros of this beach: a beautiful, impressive nine-meter waterfall that floods from the nearby Mount Biokovo. Con: if you visit Croatia during the off-season, you can look at this natural wonder, but you can't swim in its wake. Most people who visit Nugal Beach will come for a handful of reasons: to go hiking and detox on the shore, or to um, wear their birthday suit. Because of its location and seclusion within Forest Park Osejava, it's a popular area for nude bathing. When you have multiple days to have fun-in-the-sun, make sure to add this beach to your schedule.", ,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nugal+Beach/

For those used to feeling sand between their toes, the Adriatic Sea is known for this shoreside feature. The rare exception is Sunj Beach, just west of Dubrovnik. When you find an area on this usually crowded space, glance to your left and right, where you'll see bright green hills rolling in the distance. You won't find any cars on the whole island, since golf carts and bicycles are the preferred method of transportation.

Chandipur is located in Odisha's Balasore district, about four and a half hours north of capital Bhubaneshwar.
